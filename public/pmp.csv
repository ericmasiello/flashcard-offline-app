The product owner replies that the approvals are needed to check for existing patents, which would block the product from going to market. 
 
How should a project manager prevent such conflicts? 

A: Require that supporting department stakeholders attend the daily meetings to report progress. 
B: Ensure that the product owner can be easily approached to respond to team questions and concerns. 
C: Require the team to move a story to the Kanban blocked column if they have concerns about progress. 
D: Ensure that the product owner presents the team the rationale behind the refinement work flow.","B - FEEDBACK: The source of this conflict is a lack of communication, as well as inaction to prevent delay. The most comprehensive response is to ensure constant communication between the team and product owner."
"A Scrum innovation team is funded at varying levels by six (6) market units. Four (4) niche market units complain they are neglected because the team prioritizes mainstream unit goals. The marketing director suggests devoting a constant 40% of the team effort to the four (4) niche units in a balanced way.  
  
How can the team support this request? 

A: Group stories by unit; select 40% of niche stories to work on at each sprint. 
B: Split stories into mainstream or niche groups; plan 40% of niche story points at each sprint 
C: Group stories by unit; plan 10% of story points per niche unit at each sprint

"An agile team needs to decide who should represent them in the Scrum of Scrums. 
  
Which criteria should a project manager use to select the best-suited team member? 

A: How well the member knows the work in the other teams 
B: How well the member applies their depth of expertise 
C: How convincing the member is as a public speaker? 
D: How long they have been working with Agile methods",A - FEEDBACK: The most important factor to effectively collaborate between teams in a Scrum of Scrums is to understand the work across all teams. This knowledge promotes effective coordination to identify and resolve dependencies and impediments. The other qualities are mainly important within the team (expertise and influence).
"While monitoring progress of the agile team, the project manager notices that an expert member's output is much lower compared with that of junior team members. This is a surprise, as the expert works diligently on the most complex tasks and always produces defect- Free results. 
  
Which is the most likely explanation for the developer's low output? 

A: The expert works faster and reports fewer hours than the junior members. 
B: Younger team members are normally more productive. 
C: The story point estimates on the expert's work are consistently too low. 
D: The expert runs more tests and therefore completes fewer stories. ","C - FEEDBACK: Story point estimates would be used measure progress in an agile project, and actual hours worked would NOT be apparent unless readjusted. However, as an important note, an agile team is self-organized and the emphasis is on team output, NOT individual effort."

How can this best be achieved? 

A: Place monitors displaying combined feature burn-up charts and a digest of retrospectives. 
B: Use fishbowl windows to show all project teams’ Kanban boards and charts in real time. 
C: Place webcams to broadcast all Kanban boards and cycle the images sequentially on the radiator.  
D: Set up an internal Wiki page which all agile teams update in real time and users consult on demand.     ","A - FEEDBACK: The feature burn-up chart can be used as a common measure of progress, and lessons learned are recorded in retrospectives. Information radiators are physical displays used to share up-to-date information across the organization. They are NOT live cams exclusively (fishbowl and webcam distractors) and the information is NOT on demand (Wiki page)."

D: Recognize that this is a common occurrence when teams experience changes and revise the schedule to allow for the slight decrease in productivity. ",B - FEEDBACK: It is the project manager’s responsibility to make sure that the new members are adequately trained. This approach provides that training.
"A team decides that an agile approach fits the needs of the next phase in their project. Unfortunately, some team members have NOT had the appropriate agile training. 
   
How should the project manager respond to the lack of agile training? 

A: Transition some of these team members to other teams and replace them with resources with agile training. 
B: Ensure the project’s contingency reserve can cover agile training for all team members. 
C: Create virtual training sessions for key team members, covering the main agile topics. 
D: Identify and implement the most cost-effective agile training for the team members. ",D - FEEDBACK: Training for project team members can result in added skills that could be useful for future phases or projects. The project manager should identify and implement agile training for team members. Training lessons and related costs should be evaluated and included in the resource management plan and cost and schedule baselines.
"A project team has been efficiently delivering results. The product upgrade they are working on must be released in three months or else a competitor’s new product will make theirs obsolete. Citing this reason, the product owner makes a sudden request for a feature revision. However, no one on the project team is capable of doing the work. The project sponsor is willing to extend the budget but CANNOT extend the schedule. 
   
What should the project manager do? 

A: Meet the new demand by adding new resources with the required skills. 
B: Recommend suspending the project until a firm decision can be made.  
C: Discuss options with the project sponsor and choose the best one. 
D: Challenge the request and initiate customer research to determine whether the new feature is desirable. ","A - FEEDBACK: In situations with time constraints, the most efficient option is expanding the team to include skilled resources. Training is also an option if resources have the capability to learn within the timeframe. The project sponsor has already made their request, so it is up to the project manager to realize it. Agile projects are designed to function in highly complex and unpredictable environments, so suspending or cancelling the project hardly ever is an option."
"Some agile approaches have recently been added to an infrastructure company's predictive processes. The team is NOT completing the planned story points, and they are becoming passive. The project manager is concerned and wants to improve productivity. 
   
Which two actions should the project manager take? (Choose TWO.) 

A: Provide team training, so the team can do a better job of estimating story points. 
B: Speed up the project by reducing the backlog. 
C: Gain the needed time for story point completion by adding more iterations to the project. 
D: Use burndown and burnup charts to evaluate team performance and show story points completion.","A, D - FEEDBACK: Training can be a great way to empower team members to grow their skillsets. This would also create consistency in story point estimation techniques. Burndown charts show the remaining story points and burnup charts show story point completion."
"An agile approach is required during the final phase in a team’s project. As the team discusses the phase, some team members disclose that they have NOT worked with agile before. The deadline is approaching soon.  
   
How should the project manager respond? 

A: File a change request that addresses the agile training that members lack. 
B: Escalate this as an issue to the project sponsor, as it is a company-wide issue and a blocker for this project. 
C: Ask the team members who have worked with agile to mentor the others. 
D: Identify and provide the most cost-effective agile training for team members. ","D - FEEDBACK: Providing training to project team members can result in added skills that can be useful for future phases or projects. Training lessons and related costs could be evaluated to be included in the resource management and cost management plans. Mentoring is a good idea, but with a firm schedule, you may NOT have enough time to transfer skills while getting project work done. Finally, this is the project manager’s issue to deal with, NOT the project sponsors."
"A project has the following characteristics: 
   
- Schedule performance issues occur due to low expertise levels of project resources. 
- Junior-level resources are NOT completing tasks in a timely manner. 
- Highly-experienced resources report that their junior colleagues are performing unnecessary tasks. 
  
In what two ways can the project manager enhance the performance of this team? (Choose TWO.) 

A: Meet with the team leader to discuss the situation and decide if escalation to the project sponsor is necessary. 
B: Implement a whole-team training program to address efficient working and task completion. 
C: Work collaboratively with the team to design training and a checklist for task completion aligned with project goals. 
D: Design a checklist for all team members. 
E: Set up mentoring sessions within the team so that the experienced resources can coach the junior resources and work collaboratively.","C, E - FEEDBACK: Project managers should attempt to resolve issues using the tools and techniques available to them prior to changing the plan or escalating the issue. Providing training to those who need it will improve team performance and implementing a checklist ensures each team member is checking only what needs to be checked."
"During Project A’s kickoff phase, the project manager provided training for the entire team regarding the specifics of the company operations that the project supports. 
   
A year later, project productivity is suffering because members who were added later in the project do NOT have the same level of understanding. 
   
How should the project manager respond to this challenge? 

A: Tell the newer team members to ask for help from the long-term members when they run into things they do not understand. 
B: Ask current team members to provide training and support and hold a second kick-off meeting for new team members. 
C: Add new members who have the relevant experience, reassign the newer team members, and log turnover issues in the lessons learned register. 
D: Recognize that this is a natural project progression and revise the schedule to allow for the slight decrease in productivity. ",B - FEEDBACK: It is the project manager's responsibility to make sure that the new members are adequately trained. This approach provides that training.
"A technology development project has the following characteristics: 

It requires a highly skilled resource that is unavailable locally. 
 
The project manager has identified a resource who can do the work, but the resource lives in a different country and requires a work visa.  
 
The work visa process is taking more time than anticipated. 
   
What should the project manager do? 

A: Assign the existing team overtime work. 
B: Reduce the project scope.  
C: Delay the project by an equivalent duration.  
D: Request that the resource work remotely.","D - FEEDBACK: The use of virtual teams creates new possibilities when acquiring project team members. Virtual teams can be deﬁned as groups of people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face. The availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible."
"A key team member is asked to move to another project during the middle of a technical project. The team believes this is an unwise move and expresses concern. 
   
Which action will help to resolve the issue? 

A: Discuss the conflict with the project sponsor and formulate a response. 
B: Use coaching tools and techniques to motivate the project team.  
C: Replace the key team member with a new resource who has the same skills. 
D: Acknowledge the team’s concern and analyze the impact to the project.  ",D - FEEDBACK: The project manager should know how to handle key personnel changes and keep the team motivated and productive.
"A project manager is working on a small project that is critical for a larger program milestone. A new resource has been assigned to replace a key resource who had to leave the project. Unfortunately, an outside stakeholder claims that the person who assigned the new resource sent their weakest team member. 
   
How should the project manager approach this rumor? 

A: Assess the new resource’s ability to perform the necessary work by testing their communication skills with the current project team. 
B: Evaluate the skills of the new resource to see how the resource can provide value to the project. 
C: File a request with the project management office (PMO) manager in order to obtain a better resource. 
D: Address the rumor with the new resource’s functional manager to mitigate any conflict within the project team. ","B - FEEDBACK: Without seeing performance first-hand, the rumor has no validity. In general, any third-party information—hearsay or rumors, for example—is a danger to relationships in a project, as it may create strained relationships. Always investigate any suspected problems and find out the facts."
"A project manager in an organization that uses traditional project management is assigned to an ongoing project. Recently, the organization has started to use agile methodologies for projects. The project manager hears that some team members think key subject matter expertise is missing and that the team does NOT collaborate enough.  
   
How should the project manager respond to these team members' concerns? 

A: Employ third-party specialists to fill the knowledge gap. 
B: At the next standup meeting, emphasize the importance of collaboration to the entire team. 
C: Add cross- Functional internal resources and explain their value to the team. 
D: Start using Kanban boards instead of Gantt charts so that work co-dependencies become obvious to everyone. ","C - FEEDBACK: Agile projects require ""T"" shaped team members. That is, individuals who are cross- Functional and understand the importance and value of collaboration across functional areas. In this case, the team needs the addition of skilled resources and people who collaborate."
"During a technical project, a well-liked project member is reassigned to a different project. The team has expressed disapproval regarding the reassignment. 
   
What action can help mitigate the team's disapproval? 

A: Notify the project sponsor regarding the team’s disapproval and brainstorm a response. 
B: Employ leadership and emotional intelligence tools and techniques to inspire the team to continue working. 
C: Add a resource with the same skills to replace the key team member.  
D: Schedule a team-building day to keep the team happy. ",B - FEEDBACK: The project manager should know how to handle key personnel changes and keep the team motivated and productive.
"A new resource joins a working project team and is assigned to a small project that is critical to a larger program milestone. Unfortunately, the new resource is under-skilled and very nervous. The team dynamic has become awkward, and work has slowed on the small project. 
   
Which are two possible ways for the project manager to handle this situation? (Choose TWO). 

A: Assess the new resource’s communication skills to evaluate their ability to perform acceptably as part of the project team. 
B: Talk with the new resource about their skills and then determine how they can contribute to the project. 
C: Privately ask the project management office (PMO) to assign a different resource with better skills.  
D: Meet with the functional manager of the new resource to understand their background better. 
E: Solicit the team about integrating and coaching the new team member.","B, E - FEEDBACK: Without seeing performance first-hand, there is no available proof to the hearsay. Therefore, meet with the new resource to learn about their qualifications for work and introduce them to the team as you would with any other new resource."
"On an agile team, staff members from various organizational departments rotate in and out, to augment the team.  
  
How can the project manager help shield the permanent team members from disruption? 

A: Give them authority to assign tasks to the rotating members. 
B: Ask staff leaving the project to pick members who deserve recognition. 
C: Give them higher priority to choose which tasks they work on. 
D: Require staff leaving the project to run a knowledge-sharing workshop. ",D - FEEDBACK: Loss of skills is one of the most disruptive factors to a team. Knowledge-sharing workshops would mitigate this and help develop the team to be more cross- Functional.
"Before the next iteration begins, project team B meets about an unexpected challenge which threatens to delay the current phase. The task in the next iteration CANNOT be completed because of this challenge. Another team within the project is depending on timely completion of Task 1 in order to fulfill their work. 
   
How should the project manager resolve this issue? 

A: Meet with both teams separately and ask them to figure out a way to meet the required deadlines and complete the project on time. 
B: Meet with the product owner to prioritize the iteration backlog, so that it does NOT impact other teams or obligations. 
C: Increase the number of team members for the project team and increase the iteration length, ensuring that the work will be completed according to schedule. 
D: Let team members know you want them to do their best under difficult circumstances, and make sure to note the iteration's challenges in the next retrospective. ","B - FEEDBACK: In agile or adaptive environments, the product owner and the team should prioritize and reprioritize tasks they know will or might impact other work. Always consider risk exposure when prioritizing tasks."
"During a meeting, a project manager learns that a business result needs to be delivered in four (4) weeks, although the original schedule stated sixteen (16) weeks. The project manager also hears that there is NO available technical resource. The project manager knows the technical resource manager because they worked together on a previous project. 
   
What is the first thing the project manager should do? 

A: Notify the project sponsor about the lack of a technical resource.  
B: Immediately escalate the issue to decision makers in the organization.  
C: Check with the technical resource manager to see if there is an available technical resource. 
D: Hire an outside party to meet the need for a technical resource. ",C - FEEDBACK: The project manager should first confirm with the technical resource manager whether a resource is available.
"A project manager in a virtual team realizes, during the third iteration of product development, that the team dashboard that shows progress on work is faulty and is NOT showing updates. 
   
Which action should the project manager take? 

A: Keep the team working and send daily email updates to the team.  
B: Rank the need to fix the dashboard according to the business value for upcoming iterations. 
C: Get the dashboard fixed.  
D: Document the issue as a new project risk and propose a solution.  ","C - FEEDBACK: In an agile virtual team, the project manager needs to keep work visible so that the team can see progress. This is essential. Changing the way the team works together in the middle of a project can be very disruptive. In this case, they are lucky that a problem did NOT arise. The project manager needs to protect the team against impediments and allow them to focus on their work."
"Project D is working virtually because of a recent natural disaster. Several activities are delayed because a project team member has NOT been working for the past week. This impacts the critical path. 
   
How should the project manager respond to this problem? 

A: Obtain a new resource to complete the needed tasks until you can speak to the team member directly. 
B: Discuss the situation with the team member’s functional manager and enable them to manage the team member. 
C: Remind the team member about responsibility and accountability.   
D: Ask a team member who knows this person well to try and find the missing team member and report back. ","A - FEEDBACK: The team member has been away from work after a natural disaster. In addition to that, the team is working virtually, so communication is already different than when everyone was co-located in the office. Empathy is required here. Take action without being intrusive or asking others to intervene. There could be many reasons for the absence, and while the team member is your responsibility, completing the project work is your first priority."
"During an iteration, a project team working in country B encounters problems that may cause a delay in completion of task B. Teams in country A need task B to be completed on time in order to meet their schedules. These teams work together virtually.  
   
What can the project manager do to resolve this problem? 

A: Ask the team in country B to work harder to complete on time, in order to avoid delaying the work of other teams. 
B: Ask the teams to collaborate virtually to find a solution to avert the potential delay. 
C: Increase the iteration length, and add additional resources to the project team, so that they can meet the appropriate deadlines. 
D: Ask team members to perform to the best of their abilities during the iteration and engage in a retrospective after completion of the iteration. ","B - FEEDBACK: “May cause a delay” does NOT mean the task completion will be delayed. To improve the probability of success, the team should collaborate and find a solution. They know their work best, and despite working virtually, they should be able to find a solution."
"A new project manager needs to deliver a high-stakes agile project. The vendor working with the team is in another country. Though this vendor has delivered excellent quality work on time in the past, they are currently behind schedule. The team explains to the project manager that their attempts to get the vendor back on schedule have failed. They have sent emails and phoned, but the vendor only gives vague, noncommittal responses. The product owner insists that this vendor is essential to the success of the project and an important partner of the business. 
   
Which action should the project manager take? 

A: Contact the vendor and be direct about the consequences of their actions and delays 
B: Create a virtual workspace for the team so that everyone is aware of and accountable for their tasks and aware of due dates. Include the product owner. 
C: Work with procurement to amend the vendor’s service agreement, with specific terms and conditions for work.  
D: Ask the product owner to use personal influence to get the vendor back on schedule.  ","B - FEEDBACK: Communication in virtual teams can be challenging. Being direct may NOT leave a good first impression and revising a service agreement may be perceived as hostile by the vendor. This vendor is critical to the success of the project and important to the business, and the team may be getting demoralized by their unsuccessful attempts to manage the vendor. Be attentive of these factors using active listening and emotional intelligence. Creating a workspace that enables everyone on the project team to see the project work and be accountable for delivering their work on time is the best option here. Including the product owner in the virtual work space as an informed party is wise."
"A longstanding, key team member in a virtual team has been unmotivated for weeks after the death of a family member. Because of this, several project activities are behind schedule, impacting the project’s critical path. 
   
 How should the project manager handle this situation? A: Replace the team member. B: Discuss the situation with the team member and work with them to identify a workable solution. C: Escalate this situation as an HR issue and ask other team members to work overtime. D: Ask the functional manager for additional support on the project, including assignment of a new resource. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: A project manager is a servant leader. Servant leadership means listening and acting with empathy. Especially in virtual teams, facilitating servant leadership can be a challenge. Replacing the key team member is a unilateral action that project team members and others may perceive as drastic, considering the circumstances. Asking others, such as HR or the functional manager, to intervene is a good idea, but the team member should be consulted first, and asking the team to work overtime is always a gamble. Given all of this, the project is the priority here. Speak with the team member first, using emotional intelligence and empathy, but with a firm approach to completion of work as a priority."
"Several items remain in the Kanban blocked column despite the team's efforts to resolve the issues. The retrospective reveals that all of the impediments relate to mandatory corporate business processes, which introduce wait times. 
  
 What should the project manager do next? A: Act as a servant leader to resolve the pending business process issues while the team attends a team-building event.  B: Dedicate the next iteration to team training on the business processes to help them work more autonomously.  C: Work with process owners to streamline procedure and secure the team coaching on the processes.  D: Work with the team to increase the story point estimates in the backlog to account for the business process delays.  
 

  E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The servant leader should work within the organization to simplify processes affecting the team as much as possible. However, large companies typically need internal processes, so these can rarely be eliminated altogether."
"Several items remain in the Kanban blocked column despite the team's efforts to address them. The retrospective reveals that all the impediments can be traced back to a particular department head. Previously, the project manager has tried to educate this stakeholder, but they still show resistance. 
  
 What should the project manager do next? A: Ask the department head for budgetary compensation proportional to the delays incurred due to lack of cooperation. B: Use stakeholder analysis to identify an aligned senior stakeholder to influence the department head.  C: Ask the team members to find other stakeholders who can help work around the department head's barriers.  D: Set up an information radiator, ranking stakeholders according to their active support of the project goals.
 

  E: ","B - FEEDBACK: If stakeholders remain resistant despite the project manager's efforts, then escalation may be required."
"Several unforeseen impediments suddenly appear on the Kanban board in a hybrid project. Each team member has reported one or more different problems relating to a regulatory specification issued by the predictive track. 
  
 Which parameter is likely to be highest in the risk assessment? A: Manageability  B: Dormancy  C: Connectivity  D: Controllability    E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The risks are all related to a common source—the specification—so connectivity ranks high per the definition ""Where a risk is connected to many other risks, connectivity is high"". Manageability and controllability are INCORRECT because the risk factor depends on an external regulator. Dormancy is low because the risks were detected immediately after the specification was issued."
"A project manager is preparing the charter for a project. The project aims to automate 30 percent of the company’s product testing. The project sponsor advises the project manager to assign senior test engineers to identify the tests that can be automated. 
   
 The test department manager, however, is NOT cooperative because they believe that the project will lead to downsizing in their department. 
   
 Which two actions are suitable in this scenario? (Choose TWO.) A: Have a meeting with the test department manager to discuss mutual expectations.  B: Request for the project sponsor to provide a rationale for test automation. C: Present data-driven, cost-benefit evidence of test automation to the test department manager. D: Raise the risk that the senior testing engineers will NOT be available for the testing. E: Work with the project sponsor to create a project charter that the test department manager will NOT perceive as threatening.","A,C - FEEDBACK: In this scenario, the project manager’s first action is to attempt to make the stakeholder cooperative with the project. One way of doing this is presenting the data that supports the business decision."
"Project manager A identifies three critical risks with probability of a high impact on the schedule and budget of project A—this project is producing critical deliverables for the company.  
   
 The team meets to devise a solution for the risks and decides that three specific resources will be required to address the risks. However, these resources are already committed to a separate project, which is managed by project manager B. 
   
 Which party should the project manager work with first to find a solution? A: The project team members – to assist in training the new team members quickly so they can complete work on time B: The project sponsor – to request more funding for the budget in order to hire contractors C: The three resources – to convince them to join the team or, at least, agree to coach the existing team D: Project manager B – to negotiate reallocation or sharing of the three required resources E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Project manager B has the authority to reschedule or reallocate the resources, once it will NOT jeopardize project B. Going directly to the resources themselves undermines the functional manager, so this is unethical. The resources have been identified as the solution to the problem, so it is best to attempt to make this solution work first. The other options of the project sponsor and working with project team members would be secondary and tertiary options which would probably NOT work as well."
"A customer is NOT satisfied with the delivered product, saying that it was NOT what they expected. The project manager is surprised, because the agile development team delivered the product several iterations early. 
   
 What is one way that the project manager could have avoided this result? A: Required team sign off for each of the changes to the requirements  B: Set aside more resources for product testing after making changes  C: Ensured that the customer was aware of the value of demos and the approval process for the deliverable D: Ensured that the development team fully participated in the iteration review, by explaining and answering questions    
 

  E: ",C - FEEDBACK: The customer was NOT engaged enough in the project. The iteration review is the best mechanism for the team to demonstrate the product and for the customer to give feedback to ensure that expectations are met and that final stakeholder approval will be given.
"A key stakeholder voices a concern during the planning stage about whether the available resources are adequate to meet the objectives of the project. After further discussion about the requirements and the number of resources identified, the project manager is hesitant about the original plan. 
   
 Which two steps should the project manager take next? (Choose TWO.) A: Review the bounds of the negotiations for stakeholder agreement.  B: Determine the project's ultimate objectives after carefully evaluating project priorities. C: Engage in negotiations for more resources.  D: Ensure that the impact of the shortage of required resources is fully documented. E: Re-evaluate the project objectives, review the planned activities, and recalculate the resource needs.","C,E - FEEDBACK: In this case, the stakeholder’s concern should be researched before any action is taken. Once the project manager has determined the correct number and type of resources for the project, then they should use negotiation skills to achieve the proper support for the work of the project and its outcome."
"A contractor has sent an email request for urgent payment of their last invoice on a project that is going through a long execution stage with multiple contractors. 
   
 How should the project manager respond to this contractor's request? A: Negotiate payment terms through a meeting with procurement and the contractor.  B: Authorize the payment by notifying accounts payable and follow up to ensure it was made.  C: Act according to the agreed-upon commitments in the procurement management plan and the signed agreement/contract.  D: Authorize payment only after reviewing forecast spend versus actual spend to see if the actual status allows it.    
 

  E: ",C - FEEDBACK: Even an inexperienced project manager should understand that terms and conditions should be agreed before engaging a contractor to actually do project work. The procurement plan and the agreement/contract hold all data reference contracts and are the sources to guide payment activities.
"The sales and marketing director at company A reports a 40% drop in revenue and significant increase in returns for Widget version 6.0. Customers are complaining directly to customer service and the social media teams report a high rate of negative feedback. 
 

 The project team is already working on Widget version 6.1., which is a small set of upgrades and bug fixes. The director gets in touch with the team, requesting a full disclosure of the version 6.0 and 6.1 requirements. 
 

 How should the project manager interact with this stakeholder? A: Remind them that they were consulted about the agreed product requirements for versions 6.0 and 6.1; also remind the stakeholder and that the responsible and accountable stakeholders approved version 6.0 before release. B: Review the customer and market research—both qualitative and quantitative—that supported the business case for the 6.0 project. Begin by discussing the stakeholder’s role in the research. C: Let them know that you also are disappointed, but this risk was documented and listed as a probable customer/market reaction for a major version release.     D: Ask the team to perform the final demo for version 6.0 again for the director’s information.  
 

  E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The director is understandably concerned, given the negative performance of version 6.0 in the customer market. Base your interactions in a shared sense of responsibility for the failure, whether it is a real failure, whether it was predicted or probable, or whether it is a temporary or unexpected event. Avoid performing actions again that your team already made; likewise, avoid being defensive by reminding them that they had a role in approving a failed product. Neither of these will help the company achieve its strategic goals—which is what both parties are supposed to be committed to doing."
"A project has a quality management plan in place. 
   
 This plan states that project deliverables must be reviewed for quality at least five (5) business days before the deadline. Four deliverables have failed the quality requirement. 
   
 What should the project manager do? A: Generate a cause-and-effect diagram for analysis.  B: Rewrite relevant portions of the quality management plan.  C: Inquire regarding the feasibility of an internal audit of the project.  D: Contact the project sponsor and request advice.    E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Cause-and-effect diagrams break down the causes of the problem into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause."
"The project sponsor is NOT convinced that an agile track should be used in a new R&D project because the company needs to be certain that specific features will be ready for mass production by a specific date. 
  
 Which three agile methods can ensure that the sponsor's needs can be fulfilled in a hybrid project approach? (Choose THREE.) A: A product roadmap can provide a detailed breakdown  B: Requirement priorities are confirmed at each iteration   C: Incremental development reduces risk of quality delays  D: Impact mapping can be used to group related stories  E: Stories can be broken down into granular epics","B,C,D - FEEDBACK: Valid agile methods to secure on-time delivery include backlog reprioritization at every sprint, impact mapping for feature-level view, and incremental testing to secure progressive development. Roadmaps and epics are high-level, NOT detailed views—so these will NOT work."
"A project manager observes that team members are in a low mood after demos. Feedback from stakeholders is constantly causing concern for the team. As a result, the team rushes through product demos, and the interaction between the team and stakeholders is minimal. 
 

 Which action should the project manager take? A: Meet with the stakeholders and find out the root cause of their feedback. Work with the stakeholders to rectify the problems. B: Verify that the project requirements are suitable and that the team members can do the work. C: Coach the team to be more confident in their work and communicate properly with the stakeholders. D: Consult the stakeholder matrix and identify whether any of these people are known to be difficult.  
 

  E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Leading the team means understanding how they can best be successful. In this case, they are NOT communicating well with project stakeholders and risk becoming demoralized. You should perceive this behavior as a risk to the project, caused by poor communication. You will already have verified the requirements and determined that your resources are adequate. Whether or not a stakeholder is difficult, your team needs to be able to perform. If you choose to work directly with the stakeholders, then you are undermining your team. Coach the team members on how to work better with the stakeholders."
"The IT department of a glassware manufacturer enthusiastically approved the agile team's mid-project demo of quality-checking software for assembly line workers. However, the final product was considered UNUSABLE because the workers’ gloves are too thick to press the machinery’s small buttons. 
  
 What should the project manager do to avoid this kind of failure in the future? A: Contract directly with the customer department that defines the product requirements.   B: Ensure that all software releases include adjustable accessibility features.  C: Create a realistic simulation of end-user conditions for developers testing the software.  D: Plan for end users to test prototypes and incremental releases in their production environments. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Requirements and feedback from actual end users CANNOT be replaced by organizational structures, simulations, or generalized feature sets (accessibility). Contracting with the end-user department would NOT be appropriate either, as they would NOT have expertise, norms, and assets relating to how the software integrates into the larger IT environment."
"The agile team sometimes has idle periods while awaiting a product director to inform the product owner on new goals. The decisions depend on analysis of market research.  
  
 Which measure could reconcile the needs of the director and the agile team? A: Plan team training events to coincide with the anticipated idle periods. B: Run market research spikes to update the director after clearing the backlog. C: Eliminate slack by reducing the team size to smooth the output curve. D: Run team brainstorming sessions on new goals to suggest to the director.  E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Running market research spikes supports the product director and helps build and diversify team skills. If the team is idle, it means they are NOT working on stories/features in the backlog. Reducing output means negative productivity, and the team's ideas would NOT provide market facts needed to make informed product development decisions."
"An agile development team changes a design element in a project. Testing results improve dramatically over the next two iterations. At the third iteration retrospective, the product owner is unhappy to learn about the change to the original design and asks the team to redo the work based on the original design. 
  
 How can the project manager prevent such situations? A: Set out all decision path conditions in the ground rules and correct any deviations as early as possible. B: Request additional funding from the product owner for re-work due to lack of collaboration with the team. C: Ensure regular engagement with the product owner and run catch-up meetings if necessary. D: As servant leader, help the team to focus by removing all impediments.  E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The product owner has ultimate authority on the scope of the product. Thus, product owner engagement is critical when considering scope changes or any changes that may have an impact on the scope."
"A product owner repeatedly complains, saying that a function developed by the development team does NOT seem to align with the original design. 
   
 What will help to solve this issue? A: Ask the product owner to explain his point of view clearly to the team. B: Ask the quality assurance team to identify any mismatches in functionality compared to the initial design.  C: Ask the development team to rewrite the function so that it matches with the project scope.  D: Update the product owner twice per week on product development.    E: ",D - FEEDBACK: The product owner has already explained the requirements in the original design. The solution here is to keep the product owner updated on development so that the team can adjust their work if it goes out of scope.
"During a challenging stakeholder meeting, one stakeholder indicates that they will reject an iteration’s deliverable.  
   
 What should the project manager do? A: Send a request to the project sponsor, asking them to update the project charter then reassign the responsibilities and authorities.  B: Meet with the project team to add new and improved features to replace the features that were rejected.  C: Work with that stakeholder to understand their concerns and address these together with the team.  D: Request a private meeting with the stakeholder and a member of the project team to try and defuse the situation. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The project manager and the team should work with the customer to identify the reasons for rejecting the deliverable. Iteration reviews are designed to show the customer what the team has produced in that iteration. This is a perfect opportunity for the customer to raise their concerns, ask questions, and request changes. However, when this is NOT possible, as in this case, then seek a deeper understanding of the objection or concern and address it with all parties."
"A team misunderstood one product functionality documented in an earlier stage of the project. During the current iteration, the functionality has NOT yet been developed, but a business representative has mentioned the deficiency. 
   
 How should the project manager proceed? A: The functionality was formally approved, so initiate the change management process B: Schedule a meeting to discuss and brainstorm the functionality with the project team and business representative. C: Ensure that the issue is addressed by escalating it to the project sponsor, who should discuss it with the representative. D: Continue with the current sprint, recognizing that the issue will be identified during the testing phase. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: As the functionality has NOT been built, the project manager should facilitate building common understanding and empowering the team to evaluate the impact of a possible change, thus avoiding re-work."
"A project team is working with an overseas contractor based in a country that has three official languages, and every contractor on the team is multilingual. Team meetings continue to be held in the commonly shared language, but during project work meetings, contractors speak to each other in a different language. 
 

 When the project manager brings this up in the next team meeting, the contractors express regret, but they explain that they work better when they can communicate freely with each other. 
  
 How should the project manager respond first? A: Require everyone to speak the same language all of the time, even though this will slow the pace of work. B: Escalate this as an issue to the human resources department. C: Obtain formal training or translation services. D: Let the team discuss language requirements and make ground rules for team communication. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: In this case, forcing the contractors to work less efficiently may jeopardize the project. Work with the whole team to find the best solution that will NOT jeopardize the project. Escalation is NOT required unless the team is unable to find a solution. Teams need to acknowledge the diversity of its members and promote an environment of inclusiveness. Each team is unique in its character, makeup, and tolerance levels, but the high-performing teams are self-aware. Commonly agreed ground rules always make together easier, especially in heterogeneous groups."
"A project manager with limited experience managing globally distributed team members is appointed to a project with team members who are all from another country and speak a different native language.

 What of the following actions should the project manager NOT take? A: Read books about cultural sensitivity in leadership.  B: Hire a professional coach to learn how to be a more successful leader.   C: Request a different assignment, citing the language barrier as an obstacle.   D: Enroll in language and culture lessons to learn about this country.    E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Great leaders have a growth mindset. Always aim to capitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing and sustaining the project team throughout the project life cycle, and promote working together interdependently in a climate of mutual trust. In this case, you can NOT assume that there is a language barrier, as the team members may be bilingual. This answer also does NOT demonstrate a growth mindset."
"A governmental anti-money laundering software project needs a solution to collaborate with a remote agile team of four (4) people in another country. Spontaneous verbal communication between the teams must be supported. All the remote team's workstations and Kanban boards must be visible at all times. 
 

 Which virtual team collaboration solution is most appropriate? A: Information radiator monitors B: On-demand video conferencing C: Workstation screen mirroring D: Always-on fishbowl windows     E: ","D - FEEDBACK: This is a project where confidentiality and security are critical—thus, permanent monitoring of remote resources is necessary. Only the fishbowl window solution would have the required field of view on a permanent basis. Radiators only display content, on-demand video conferencing would NOT be a permanent video feed, and mirroring only displays one (1) computer screen, NOT the environment."

 Which two measures should the project manager take to achieve shorter, more efficient daily meetings? (Choose TWO). A: Use the iteration reviews to discuss the Kanban board. B: Require all members to stand during the full meeting. C: Place a single webcam to face the Kanban boards and teams. D: Ask the team members to raise blockers off-line.  E: Limit speakers to only members who have made progress.","B,C,D - FEEDBACK: Standing meetings limited to one webcam per group have been shown to reduce meeting times without losing efficiency."
"A company is constructing recycling plants in fifteen (15) countries around the world. The lead in the project management office (PMO) wants more timely progress reporting and experience sharing between project managers in each of the geographically distant projects. 
  
 Which two agile methods might the PMO use to fulfill this need? (Choose TWO). A: Definition of Done  B: Electronic Kanban board  C: Backlog refinement  D: Virtual daily standup meetings  E: 2-week retrospective","B,E - FEEDBACK: A Kanban board would provide timely progress reporting, and bi-weekly retrospective calls would be a forum for sharing recent experiences and lessons for improvement. The Definition of Done is wrong because it focusses only on completion criteria, while backlog refinement and Scrum of Scrums would only be valid if all PMs are working on a common product."
"A planned task in a sprint was nearly NOT completed because of an issue that appeared three (3) days prior but was NOT resolved. The team resolved it in the next daily standup meeting, but the project manager wants to prevent this type of situation in the future. 
   
 What should the project manager do? A: During the retrospective, examine the issue.  B: In the demo, address the issue.  C: During the next iteration planning meeting, discuss the issue.  D: Send an email to the team.    E: ","A - FEEDBACK: A retrospective is a great opportunity to talk about what went right, what went wrong, lessons learned, and what to improve for next time."
"A project manager went on a vacation and returned to discord. According to two stakeholders, stakeholder C is causing problems. Every day for the last two (2) weeks, stakeholder C sent an email to the team, checking progress and giving new instructions. The team ignored the emails and continued working, but the other stakeholders are concerned about stakeholder C’s behavior. 
 

 What should the project manager do? A: Instruct the two stakeholders to ignore stakeholder C, just as the team did.  B: Invite everyone to a meeting and work through the communication issue. C: Initiate a private conversation with stakeholder C and resolve this problem. D: Investigate the problem to find the root cause.

 How should the project manager deal with this new development? A: Inform the agile team that resulting changes will be postponed as long as possible. B: Be patient and wait until the board gives the team explicit instructions, then decide. C: Speak with the product owner to add this change to the backlog.  D: Negotiate a quiet period with the board to prevent disruption to the team's work E: ","C - FEEDBACK: An action needs to be taken in this scenario, NOT a deferral of any kind. The product owner needs to be involved, and this change needs to be added to the backlog. Backlog refinement is controlled by the product owner but requires a team effort. The product owner also can change the Definition of Done or include the changes in the acceptance criteria."

 How should the project manager respond to this proposed change? A: Perform an impact evaluation of this change request and evaluate the change in scope. B: Work with key stakeholders and project team members to discuss the business requirements.  C: Modify the original project schedule to meet the revised deadline.  D: Meet individually with project team members to discuss which aspects of the project can be removed from the scope. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: To execute the project more quickly, the project team should discuss with the stakeholders if there can be any reduction of scope and find out the way to complete activities at the individual level within a shorter time, if possible."
"A project manager needs to ensure that the team delivers business value within the required timelines. The project manager recently learned that key stakeholders are worried that the current release plan will NOT meet urgent business needs.  
   
 How can the project manager effectively respond to stakeholder concerns? A: Renegotiate scope with the project sponsor after examining the work breakdown structure (WBS). B: Consult with the stakeholders and team members to identify the minimum viable product (MVP) needed for launch.  C: Determine the schedule performance index (SPI), then escalate the schedule risk to the project sponsor.  D: Monitor progress using a burndown chart after modifying the schedule baseline to meet stakeholder requirements. E: ",B - FEEDBACK: Defining the minimum viable product would allow the team to release business value within timelines by focusing only on the must-have items that the business stakeholders need.
"A customer indicates that they would like to add a functionality to a product in development. Although this request is made during the execution stage of the project, the project manager determines that the cost for the addition would be small. The additional functionality, if successful, would increase the opportunity for profit.  
   
 What should the project manager do next? A: Acknowledge that the functionality would offer a great opportunity but determine that the proposed addition is out of scope.   B: Submit a change request and then evaluate the impact to the project.  C: Move forward, using the project's management reserve to add the requested functionality.  D: Identify an already-developed feature that could be combined with the new functionality and use the combination to meet the customer's request.     
 

  E: ","B - FEEDBACK: If the customer asks the project manager to make a change, regardless of how small or little impact, the change needs to go through Perform Integrated Change Control. The first step would be to submit a change request and then analyze the impact."
"During one daily standup meeting, team members suggest that rework is being caused because there seems to be too much work.  
   
 How should the project manager respond to this? A: Try using a Kanban board for reviews.  B: Request that team members explicitly implement time boxing or spikes.  C: Replace the under-performing team members.  D: Investigate to determine whether this is a time or quality issue.    E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Rework can often be caused by trying to do too much in too little time—or it can be an issue of the quality of work. If time is the issue, then time boxing or spikes are great techniques to focus work efforts. If quality is the issue, then you need to assess resources, materials, skill level, and so on. But you need to understand what is causing the rework first."

With regard to planning, the team needs to figure out how to prioritize the backlog so that a product with basic functionality—and which also represents value to the customer—can enter the market."
"The pandemic has caused delays which will make it very difficult to launch the new product on time. Television ads for the launch date are already purchased, so the CEO has asked the project manager to find a way to launch the product even if some minor features are NOT included. 
  
 Which measure would be the most effective step toward a successful and timely product launch? A: Double the size of the test team to ensure that any defects will be detected and corrected as early as possible.  B: Ask the team to remove product tests most likely to fail at first attempt and de-scope requirements relating to those tests.  C: Fast-track the schedule and establish new test and readiness milestones as close as possible to the planned launch date.   D: Plan a parallel iterative track to develop requirements for a minimum viable product (MVP) and de-scope unnecessary predictive tasks. E: ",D - FEEDBACK: The MVP is specifically intended to increase product success through customer feedback while accelerating development through minimizing effort. Schedule compression or scope reduction alone may be based on unneeded requirements.

The prototype scores 95% on fulfilment of the functional requirements defined in the scope, which is a passing score in the project’s agreed quality metrics. 
 

 The franchise group is unwilling to approve the prototype since it does NOT fulfill a particular functional requirement, but the direct customer group gives approval. 
 

 How can the project manager handle communication with this diverse stakeholder group?  A: Send a survey to each group asking for specific feedback on the prototype. B: Thank the customers for their approval; review the WBS and verify the requirements documentation with the franchise group. C: Hold a consultation with the franchise group, show them the direct customer approval, and negotiate for the approval.  D: Check the RACI matrix for which group’s approval is needed and if still unclear, ask an executive stakeholder to make the final decision. 
 

  E: ","B - FEEDBACK: At this phase of a project, the project team and stakeholders should benefit from good communications.

"A security-classified, agile software project requires outside expertise and delivery to add a module based on machine learning. An approved supplier asks the project manager to join the daily meeting with the supplier's agile team, but the project manager's schedule is too full with internal meetings. 
  
 How could the two teams synchronize interactively but somewhat less frequently?  A: Set up fishbowl windows at each site. B: Add and execute a Scrum of Scrums layer. C: Align iterations for common retrospectives. D: Share a common electronic Kanban.  E: ",B - FEEDBACK: The Scrum of Scrums allows both teams to have their own daily meetings while adding a more targeted meeting between them at a less frequent pace.
"The latest software build for a virtual reality headset release did NOT include urgent change requests already implemented by the electronics workstream. The product owner informed the software team about the change during a daily meeting, but NO ONE recorded it. 
  
 What should the project manager do to avoid this problem in the future? A: Refine the product backlog with the team and product owner before the next iteration. B: Increase the frequency of backlog refinement meetings and note the change in the retrospective.  C: Run an ad-hoc retrospective and add the agreed urgent change process to the team charter.  D: Privately remind the team lead that the role requires fast and proactive problem solving. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: In this case, iterative agile change handling is NOT fast enough. Continuous improvement in agile is achieved through retrospectives, and work processes are in the team charter. If you wait until the next iteration, it will be too late to catch the change; more frequent backlog refinements violate the principle of ""maximizing work not done""; and servant leaders would NOT impose on a team member to improvise."
"A smart grid project combines predictive and agile tracks. The agile team detected a major software defect after its release and began working on a correction. But the defective release was deployed by the predictive track, and this caused a field test to fail. 
  
 Which measure would be most effective to prevent similar problems in the future? A: Run the same unit tests in the agile lab and in the field sites.  B: Send project-wide issue log updates via instant messaging.  C: Ensure that retrospectives are shared with the predictive team.  D: Replan the software track into the predictive schedule    E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The root problem is that impactful information in the agile team was NOT passed to the predictive team quickly enough to prevent the test failure.

 Before deciding on next steps, what should the project manager do? A: Check the service level agreement (SLA) established with the vendor.  B: Review the procurement management plan and contract agreements.  C: Check the internal quality assurance reports.  D: Review the resource management plan and document lessons learned. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: A contract is a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide the speciﬁed products, services, or results; obligates the buyer to compensate the seller; and represents a legal relationship that is subject to remedy in the courts."
"Near the end of a manufacturing project, several team members are transferred to another project. To complete the work, the project manager needs to acquire additional resource support from a new supplier but is concerned about the cost risk of using a new supplier at this advanced stage of the project.  
   
 Now, the project manager needs to work with the procurement team to establish specifications and type of contract to be used. 
   
 What should be done? A: Recommend a time and material (TM) contract.  B: Recommend a fixed price incentive fee (FPIF) contract.  C: Recommend a cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) contract.  D: Recommend a firm fixed price (FFP) contract. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: A fixed price incentive fee contract (FPIF) is a type of contract where the buyer pays the seller a set amount (as deﬁned by the contract), and the seller can earn an additional amount if the seller meets deﬁned performance criteria."
"A deliverable does NOT meet the agreed-upon quality specifications and is rejected by the customer. After investigation, the project team finds a fault with the vendor-provided parts. This fault caused the issue. The vendor says that they CANNOT correct the situation.

"A medical equipment vendor is running a hybrid project which includes some custom software development by an agile team. The team progress is good, but slow customer approval causes unnecessary delays. The customer insists that approval can only be given after repeating all the test cases in the target environment.
 

 How can the project manager accelerate the approvals and build customer trust at the same time? 
  A: Invite the customer to send representatives to witness the team's testing to pre-approve the tests.  B: Work out an arrangement with the customer to defer as many tests as possible to the final release. C: Propose new terms for team members to work aside the customer testers to run tests in their environment. D: Allow the team to progress at their pace while the customer continues to test and approve earlier builds.  E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Agile seeks to maximize transparency between supplier and customer as well as optimizing to remove unnecessary work. Combining teams to remove work duplication is the best option. 
 

 Witnessing only would NOT remove duplicated work; deferring tests is always bad practice because defects are NOT detected at the earliest possible point; and unsynchronized progression between the teams would potentially cause rework if defects are found."
"An organizational change program has met with internal resistance, a risk which was previously identified. A logistics manager is particularly affected, due to reduction of the team size and the rate of change driven by an agile planning of the predictive implementation. The manager's supervisor formally requests the change program to delay implementation for the logistics team.
 

 What should the project manager do next in response to this request?  A: Work with the program sponsor to re-prioritize the program backlog sequence. B: Request that the sponsor escalate the strategic issue to the executive committee. C: Perform root-cause analysis on the key factors causing the manager's resistance. D: Review the risk register and implement the relevant risk response for the case. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Stakeholder resistance was anticipated and multiple risk responses are likely to exist, so reviewing the risk register is the correct response.

E: Add a process so the marketing director can approve each story.","A,D - FEEDBACK: The Definition of Ready and user value ranking in the backlog address the root problem, which is that the team is NOT focusing on value."
"An agile innovation team is highly productive. However, the Head of Operations informs the product owner that the company is NOT getting sustainable return on investment from the team's work.  
  
 How should the product owner address the problem? A: Define a minimum viable product (MVP) with the team and prioritize relevant backlog items. B: Reduce the number of team members as necessary to guarantee a positive return on investment. C: Identify minimum marketable features (MMF) and prioritize relevant backlog items. D: Work with the project manager to run a retrospective and perform project cancellation. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Frequent release of smaller incremental products is the fastest way to get return on investment. MMFs are ready for public launch, whereas MVPs are releases that are just able to function. Reducing the team would NOT enable acceleration of value, as is required in this case."
"The success of an ongoing agile project is measured as follows: 
 

  2-week Stories  Stories Planned  Earned 
  Sprint Planned  Completed  Value  Value 
 

  1  15  10  450K  300K 
  2  20  18  600K  540K 
  3  20  25  800K  1000K  
  4  22  25  1100K  1250K  
  
 What two (2) conclusions can be drawn from these figures? (Choose two) A: The team worked less efficiently over time. B: The team kept a steady rate of efficiency. C: The backlog was NOT prioritized for time to value. D: The backlog was prioritized for time to value. E: The team worked more efficiently over time.","C,E - FEEDBACK: The table shows that value increases over time (meaning late time to value) when dividing planned value/stories planned. The SPI above 1 (stories completed/stories planned) shows that the team completed more stories faster over time."
"A company is losing market share to disruptive competitors with new business models. A cross- Functional agile team has been formed to recommend ways to recover market share. 
  
 How can the team increase their chance of producing successful recommendations? A: Gain a deep understanding of why customers are disappointed by the company's products. B: Focus on enabling profitable delivery of unique, high-quality, and innovative products. C: Understand how the competitors' business models can reach more consumers at a lower cost. D: Focus on understanding the value consumers seek and the value competitors offer. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The first principle of the Agile Manifesto focuses on value: ""Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."" Markets are driven by the value consumers attribute to the offerings. The team needs to focus on understanding the value consumers seek and the value competitors offer in order to product successful recommendations."
"Over the past six months, the development cost per story has risen by more than 250% due to a faulty platform which is NO longer supported. The product vision highlights unique features of the platform as a pre-requisite for the product. 
  
 What should the project manager do to determine next steps? A: Cancel the project due to exceeding the budget constraint. B: Ask the product owner to select an alternative platform. C: Cancel the project as the product vision CANNOT be fulfilled. D: Run what-if cost impact scenarios with the product owner. E: ",D - FEEDBACK: Foundational assumptions for the product can no longer be fulfilled in an economically sustainable way. The product owner will need analysis of the possible scenarios to determine if the project can be continued.
"The agile team will take over from another supplier to maintain a client's website. The team notices that recent browser changes imply that most of the website's existing content would now require users to install a plug-in.  
  
 How should the agile team move forward? A: Inform the client and propose an impact analysis. B: Update all pre-existing code to remove plug-in dependencies. C: Inform the client about the previous supplier's negligence. D: Deliver the code updates as defined in the contract  E: ","A - FEEDBACK: In this case, the client needs to be aware of the impact of the recent plug-in issue on business and costs."
"The quarterly results show that competitors are driving prices down. The company is losing market share and midway into a product development project, it appears the sponsoring unit is not likely to get return on their investment. 
  
 Which two actions should the project manager take to adapt the project to these new conditions? (Choose TWO). A: Incrementally replace local staff with outside expert staff who can work at half the hourly rate or less.  B: Re-scope the project to deliver the same features as the competitors to match their pricing.  C: Make a cost/benefit analysis of deliverables to optimize delivery cost and speed. D: Fast-track the remainder of the project to deliver the intended scope with lower overhead costs.  E: Create an agile track to incrementally maximize value within a fixed budget.","C, E - FEEDBACK: Cost/benefit analysis and fixed-budget incremental development are correct because they address the loss of profitability without disruption to business."
"A pharmaceutical project includes an agile team of doctors who analyze human tissue scans from drug trial patients. The CEO wants to leverage Machine Learning (ML) technology, because it is proven to be faster and more accurate than doctors in scan analysis. 
  
 How should the product owner proceed in response to the CEO's wish? A: Record the risk in the register and plan for discussing a response in the retrospective. B: Work with the team to plan how to use the ML resources and produce a business case. C: Anticipate a negative response from the team and be ready to persuade them that their time and skill will be better spent elsewhere.  D: Ask the team to produce a SWOT analysis supporting human-based validation. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The project owner works for the business and supports the CEO decision. ML is an accelerative tool, NOT a replacement for experts. Working with the team to plan their new ways of working and using a business case to support the decision is in the company's and team's best interests. Though you should use emotional intelligence to help the team realize the next step, focus on how the team can be involved, NOT on another, unknown future."
"As part of an organizational change program, an experienced project manager with agile experience and certification is hired by a company with a strong predictive culture. 
  
 Which two actions can the project manager take to start helping the company adopt agile methodologies? (Choose TWO.) A: Ensure that the MoSCoW method is used to write all project requirements. B: Analyze all planned projects to pick the appropriate agile model. C: Show stakeholders how agile can increase quality and decrease risk. D: Train project teams to be more self-reliant and cross- Functional. E: Identify opportunities for incremental business value delivery.","C,E - FEEDBACK: Agile adoption is enabled through communicating and demonstrating its benefits."
"An agile team needs to decide who should represent them in the Scrum of Scrums. 
  
 Which option should be used to select the best-suited team member? A: Scrum  B: DevOps  C: eXtreme Programming  D: CI/CD    E: ","B - FEEDBACK: DevOps is designed to eliminate the potential impediments and gaps that cause incidents in the cycle of development, deployment and use of software and IT resources. CI/CD is included within DevOps and therefore CI/CD alone would NOT address as many problems. XP and Scrum would NOT address coordination with operations."
"User testing on the last product release revealed low user interest in certain features that required a significant effort to develop. The team feels demoralized, and they want to make sure their future efforts are worthwhile. Success in the next iteration is critical as the competitor product is gaining market share.
 

 How should the team respond? A: Team can brainstorm how to better understand the product vision. B: Scrum master can coach the product owner on prioritizing the desired end-user features and engaging stakeholders. C: Team lead can arrange a training session for everyone to learn about the benefits of a growth mindset. D: Team lead can perform stakeholder analysis to find subject matter experts (SMEs) who can guide the backlog value ranking process. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The product was released without sufficient user input or prioritization to ensure it has appeal and delivers business value. SME input (for example from marketing or market researchers) can help with ranking the features appropriately, but the deficiency points to the product manager. The person in this role needs to understand how to work with stakeholders in a more effective way so that the team is spending time and effort developing features that are relevant and represent value."
"A product owner has created a lot of epics and has started breaking them down into user stories. These high-priority user stories fulfill the definition of ready. At the iteration planning meeting, the product owner leaves after 2 hours.
 

 What should happen next? A: The team lead should draft the remaining acceptance criteria before starting the iteration.
  B: The iteration planning ends after the estimate and team commitment.
  C: The product owner should present the committed user stories with the key stakeholders before the iteration starts.
  D: The team should decompose the user stories into tasks. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The team should continue where the product owner stopped and complete this activity that began as a collaborative exercise with the product owner. The team can decompose the user stories into tasks, then estimate them before putting them on the board. They can continue this work for the rest of the iteration planning meeting."
"While the team coordinates delivering the latest version of a machine-learning product, a client stakeholder shows signs of resistance. The team lead suspects this is because the stakeholder feels their job is threatened by the automation in the product.
 

 Which approach should the team lead take to effectively reduce the stakeholder’s resistance? A: Ask the client to replace this stakeholder to avoid project delays. B: Ask the stakeholder to express their concerns and ensure full transparency. C: Express empathy directly to the stakeholder to gain cooperation. D: Tell the stakeholder that their cooperation and patience are appreciated. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Transparency and active listening are key elements to gain trust. Lack of trust is often the root cause of resistance. While empathy and appreciation help gain trust, they do NOT necessarily promote better communication, as active listening would. Swapping out the stakeholder based on an assumption would be unprofessional and damage trust with the client."
"A project is more than halfway finished. The project manager noticed that the teams have not been conducting retrospectives at the end of every sprint. Instead, they are conducting them after the release, which is every 6 months. When the project manager addresses this problem during the all-hands meeting, the team responds that retrospectives are a waste of time because nothing changes. 
 

 What should the project manager do in this situation? A: Respect the decision of the self-organized team. B: Explain to the team that retrospectives are required in agile teams.  C: Encourage the team to conduct retrospectives more frequently than twice a year because this is a chance to talk about what works and what doesn’t. D: Agree with the team that there is little benefit in doing retrospectives after every sprint. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The purpose of the retrospective is to discuss performance as they experience it—on a “trial and error” basis—and for the team to incorporate continuous improvement. Not every action item will result in a best practice or be an improvement. However, it is essential that the team continues to try. As the leader, it is the project manager's role to encourage and reinforce good practice."
"A collocated agile team is updating the ground rules based on the last iteration and retrospective. 
 

 Which option should be excluded from the new ground rules? A: Tell the truth and address any issues to the correct party (at the right time). B: There shall be no email or surfing the web during team meetings and be present on-site between 9: 00 am and 4: 00 pm. C: Ask for clarification if you are confused and do not interrupt one another. D: There shall be no swearing during team meetings and participation in chess club on Monday evenings is mandatory. E: ",D - FEEDBACK: Politeness and attendance at leisure activities are typically NOT part of the ground rules.
"In a product demo meeting, an engineering specialist presents the latest test-driven development prototype and asks for team feedback. Team member Y interrupts the demo to protest about the high cost of the prototype. Members of the engineering team immediately become defensive and begin answering all at once. 
 

 What action should the project leader take in this situation? A: Intervene and state that the cost query will be considered but remind everyone that this demo is for product development feedback. B: Stop the meeting. Firmly tell everyone to calm down and control the rest of the meeting. C: Take the opportunity to address team member Y’s concern during the meeting. D: Allow the team to work through the disruption and the problem on their own. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: As an effective team lead, you need to know when people are behaving in ways that will have a negative effect on the team. In this case, Y is behaving like a bully and the behavior threatens the stated purpose of the meeting. You should NOT respond by behaving like an authoritarian. Leaving the team to work out a problem might take a very long time and uncover even more emotional responses. If you can get the meeting back on track with a quick reminder, this is the best option."
"A project team is completing a sprint. This team normally performs well under time pressure. But this time, something seems different. The workrooms are quiet, and people are having conversations that seem secretive. A check of the scrum board shows that work is on schedule and quality checks are met, yet the team lead feels anxious.
 

 What should the team lead do? A: Assume everything is fine and let the team continue working. B: Think about any other recent changes or reasons that could be the cause of these anxious feelings. C: Ask everyone to give a quick report of how they think the sprint is going at the next standup. D: Tell the team you are feeling anxious about their work. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: If the data shows positive signs that work is on track and you are feeling anxious or unsure, then it's a good idea to trust your instinct. Something could be happening outside of the project, and your awareness of it might be causing concern. Try to identify the cause of your anxiety on your own without spreading worry or alerting the team about it. Assuming everything is fine would be alright, but without some introspection to analyze the context of the project, your anxiety might affect the team."
"A project team member is having an extremely difficult and busy personal life. The team is NOT aware. They only see mistakes and missed deadlines. The team is in the middle of an iteration and this team member’s latest mistake has caused a major issue. 
 

 How should the team lead respond in this situation? A: Coach the team member.
  B: Replace the team member.  C: Discipline the team member.
  D: Consult the team member’s functional manager. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Team performance is the focus of an agile team. If a team member is underperforming, then the team lead should coach them as much as possible to improve performance."
"A project team leader is reading feedback from a survey given to key functional manager roles. The project aims to introduce a new service to improve an internal process that will affect all of them. One of the questions was “What do you hope to learn or gain from this project?” The answers varied widely among the four team members.
 

 Manager J - I am excited to learn about the new technical service and add it to my team’s core competencies.
 Manager K - I want to learn how the new service can help my team do their job better.
 Manager H - Maybe not much. I already know how this service is supposed to work.
 Manager M - I’m not sure. I’ll wait and see.
 

 

 How should the project team leader support the growth and development of this group? A: Assume everyone’s goals should match the highest levels (J & K), use a positive servant leadership approach, and expect H & M to buy in over time. B: Ask H & M to explain their skepticism or lack of enthusiasm. Also ask J & K to coach H & M. C: Calculate the median response and assume this as a benchmark. Figure out how to motivate everyone equally. D: Circulate a follow-up survey after the first service demo and re-evaluate the responses. If anyone still seems skeptical, then consider a face-to- Face meeting to find out why. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: You should expect a variety of responses to change. While a data-driven approach will be useful, it needs to be accompanied by a personal, hands-on approach. Play the role of a mentor here, to show and explain to others the benefit of the project. Begin by asking them again, with greater detail, give them a chance to respond, analyze the responses, and work with them until they are more satisfied with the changes. Of course, this approach will NOT always work, but a personal, mentor or coaching approach that leverages personal influence and emotional intelligence is one of the best ways to quell skepticism or fear that accompanies change."
"A project team is being sent overseas to lead an integration project at a subsidiary factory. To prepare, they review a transcript from the retrospective from a previous trip to identify the main problems.
 

 Which problem listed below can the team approach and potentially solve using servant leadership and active listening during the next iteration? A: Host team is very unwilling to partner in training exercises. B: Scheduling problems because host teams have dedicated non-working hours at different times of the day due to shift work.
   C: Heatwave during site visit, so outdoor practical training was replaced by simulations. D: Equipment is at risk from poor quality maintenance because of ineffective training E: ","A - FEEDBACK: It is possible to understand why another team would be unwilling to do something and then seek a resolution. Use empathy and active listening to try to understand, but also inspire the host team with the use of servant leadership. Scheduling problems, adverse weather, and incomplete training need practical, technical solutions."
"The team lead is having a coaching session with a team member. Read the scenario and answer the question. 
 

 Lead: We've noticed that your work is a few days late again.
 

 Team Member C: It is. I took extra time to fine-tune settings before handing off to the release team.
 

 Lead: OK. We have been through this for the last four sprints, and we need to resolve it. After sprint 3, you blamed a faulty technical setup for the delay, but we found out that was not accurate. Do you think you can give us more realistic estimates next time?
 

 Team Member C: Yes, I was wrong. I thought I was giving realistic estimates, but I realize that after three sprints, my method must be flawed.
 

 Lead: Do you want to do a planning session together so we can figure out a better way?
 

 Team Member C: Yes, that would be helpful. I know that my delay is causing stress on the team. Thanks!
 

 Which two steps in emotional intelligence (EI) has this team member just realized? (Choose two) A: Self-control B: Self-discovery C: Self-assessment D: Self-definition E: Self-management","C,E - FEEDBACK: This team member has just completed an accurate self-assessment, thanks to the coaching session. This is the step when the team member declares that “I realize. . .” The next step is self-management, which happens when we accept responsibility for our actions. When the team member admitted they wrongly blamed something else in sprint 3, they accepted responsibility and demonstrated self-managing behavior."
"To improve its culture for workers, an organization’s leadership team wants to provide childcare services. Other personal services such as wellness and financial counseling are planned for the next calendar year. The project team needs to decide how to implement the new services. Leadership wants these services in place as soon as possible. The team holds a brainstorming session.
 

 Which two questions should the team explore to begin implementation of the services? (Choose two.) A: Is this part of the company’s growth strategy? B: How will the company determine who is eligible for the services? C: How many team members and which skills will be required to implement the services? D: Will the services be contracted out or maintained by company employees? E: What are the benefits of these services?","C,D - FEEDBACK: To get this critical project started right away, the team needs to decide about the composition of the implementation team and how to provision the services mandated by leadership as quickly and effectively as possible. Decisions about the strategic importance and benefits have already been made; we can assume this is why the project has executive approval. After these decisions are made, the team can explore eligibility and the type of care offered."
"A project’s goal is to improve a company’s customer service process through automation and staff development. The team sent initial surveys to the staff to assess their satisfaction with the current process and are now analyzing the responses. These are the top four responses: 
 

 • The current process works fine.
 • The current process needs fixing.
 • We need better training.
 • We do not need any more training.
 

 Which two activities should the project team perform first? (Choose two) A: Job satisfaction survey B: Likelihood-to-recommend (LTR) survey C: Risk analysis D: MoSCoW diagram E: Lessons learned","C,D - FEEDBACK: The team needs to perform further discovery—and quickly! The point of view of the end users is critical information and, in this case, it includes contradictory information which could signal the beginning of a conflict. A risk analysis and a clearer or more detailed profile of the problem are needed. The team needs to understand the current situation so that it can plan and implement the correct improvements to avoid conflict between stakeholders or between stakeholders and the project later on."
"A project manager has drafted a project management plan. While working with the stakeholders, the project manager observes that the key stakeholder’s priorities for the scope and schedule are vastly different from the priorities of all of the other stakeholders. 
 

 Key stakeholder - site upgrades and user improvements in a 9-month project schedule
 Stakeholders F, K, and S - user improvements in a 3-month project schedule
 

 Stakeholder A has openly stated that the broader scope and longer schedule are necessary for project success.
 

 What should the project manager do first in order to get this project management plan approved? A: Ask the key stakeholder to present data to support the business case for a longer schedule and broader scope. B: Negotiate with all stakeholders until they agree to common scope and schedule baselines. C: Facilitate a meeting with all stakeholders to agree to the scope and schedule baselines. D: Proceed with the key stakeholder’s scope and schedule baselines. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Asking the key stakeholder for data that supports the business case for a longer schedule and broader scope is the best choice here. Successful project outcomes support business objectives. If the key stakeholder can produce this information, then the others should agree or a negotiation can then take place. The key stakeholder's point of view probably matters more than that of the others. However, even the key stakeholder’s point of view needs to be evaluated and verified with data before any action is taken."
"An agile team has identified several risks during their last retrospective, including the chance of hiring a contractor to double the speed of a critical investigation during the next iteration.
 

 How should the team classify this risk? A: Emergent B: Issue C: Threat D: Opportunity E: ","D - FEEDBACK: This is an opportunity, because the change helps the team to mitigate a key dependency; most teams would like to reduce the number of dependencies."
"A production streamlining project is halfway complete. The team is working well together and optimistic about achieving their goals. The company is having significant personnel issues and has lost many of their senior technicians to start-ups that were offering great salaries. 
 

 To make matters worse, the VP of manufacturing requests to use the team’s most senior technical resource for a major new project kicking off next week.
  
 What should the team lead do? A: Ask the VP if the resource can be shared until the streamlining project is complete. B: Make the case for keeping the resource to ensure project outcomes are realized. C: Reallocate the team member to manufacturing and hire two generalists for streamlining. D: Outsource that resource's responsibilities on the streamlining team to a specialist. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The project outcome is the highest priority for the team lead, so they should do whatever they can to protect it. The other choices can be very compelling, if we consider the politics of the organization and the value of the team member. While it is NOT wise to ignore the value of that individual to the company, the lead’s priority still has to be the project outcome. Well-organized project teams should NOT be dependent on any one member, no matter how talented or skilled they are. However, in this case, the organization's personnel issues must be considered. If getting to an agreement is NOT possible, the issue needs to be escalated for resolution. While a team member may be valuable, an organization has many resources and projects to protect and nurture."
"At a company party, people are having a friendly, open conversation about which team is the fastest. One person laughs and says that team A has a velocity of 20, whereas team B has a velocity of 40, so team B members will all be receiving bonuses. 
 

 How should the leader of team A react? A: Be embarrassed that team B is more effective than team A. B: Say nothing. It’s a party. C: Ask that person how they know this and remind them that it is against company culture to be so competitive. D: Say nothing, because each team has its own capacity, and velocity is not used to compare teams. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Velocity is about capacity, not effectiveness. Velocity numbers are unique for each team. They cannot be used to compare teams."
"Enterprise Z has partnered with a company to deliver a certain number of phone SIM card chips each month. The results are reviewed each month at the joint steering committee meeting. Enterprise Z has been clear about their preferences and tolerances in the service-level agreements. 
  
 What is the best tool to monitor the delivery of products? A: Scatterplot diagram B: Control chart diagram C: Affinity diagram D: Cause and effect diagram E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The control chart diagram is the best tool to use as it shows the mean, upper/lower control limits, along with the standard deviation. Using this chart will help identify outliers for root cause analysis (RCA) to unveil if it is a special or common cause, as well as help to more easily spot trends."
"An agile team is nearing the end of the project and has been able to complete all stories and deliver value to the client. However, the coach has noticed that the coding standards are NOT up to par. 
 

 What should the team do? A: Update the definition of done. B: Notify the customer. C: Add the work to the backlog, prioritized alongside bug fixes. D: Update the code during the sprint dedicated to ensuring quality. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Teams often dedicate a sprint to ensure quality. None of the other answer options address and prioritize quality, and that is the issue here."
"Organization ABC merged with Company XYZ. The project management office (PMO) creates a team with the required expertise. They decide to prioritize an evaluation of company processes, then figure out what needs to be done to create an interim organization that meets the leadership's needs.
 

 Which two techniques should the project team use? (Choose two) A: Value stream mapping B: Decision-tree analysis C: Gap analysis D: Brainstorming sessions E: Qualitative analysis","A,C - FEEDBACK: The best solution is to create value stream mapping and conduct a gap analysis. These actions will help the team to identify what needs to be created and/or updated to meet the stakeholders’ needs. Brainstorming is an ideation technique, so is not quite the right choice for the current need. Decision-tree analysis is helpful when analyzing quantitative data, and qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to analyze value or prospects based on non-quantifiable information. Neither of these is will assist directly with the current task."
"A project manager joins a project with the following features: 
 

 -Globally distributed team
 - Fixed budget 
 -Very tight deadlines
 

 How can the project manager avoid scope creep and keep the team focused on delivering a product that meets requirements during planning? A: Ask all development team leads to prepare detailed requirements. B: Hold daily standups with all of the development teams. C: Put any changes to scope through the formal change request process.  D: Prevent stakeholders from direct interaction with the team leads. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Adherence to the agreed-upon change management process will help to avoid scope creep. While the other methods could be helpful, adherence to the change process is a direct solution."
"A client is making a lot of small, minor change requests, indicating that they are urgent and critical. 
 

 Which action should the project manager take?  A: Log each change request in the log. B: Reject the minor changes. C: Escalate the client's behavior to the sponsor because it is annoying the team. D: Put the requests into the iteration backlog. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Even though a client is making very minor change requests, every single one needs to be processed. Frequent, minor requests are not a cause for escalation. Project managers cannot reject change requests from stakeholders and clients. Finally, putting the requests into the iteration backlog is not the correct response to a change."
"An agile team is in dire need of additional resources, so the department decides to add another agile team. A few teams are possible candidates, so management decides on using a performance test to decide which team to add for 10 iterations.
 

 Who should be responsible for hiring the new team? A: Existing agile team B: Team lead C: Management D: Product owner E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Hiring and firing are management tasks. The other roles may take part during the test and work with the acquired team, but the hiring decision is up to management."
An agile team has been asked to update the project artifacts because new team members are joining soon. Which two of the following should be updated? (Choose two) A: Vision statement B: Burnup chart C: Milestone slip chart D: Information radiator E: Roadmap,"B,D - FEEDBACK: The burnup chart and information radiator are the best choices to communicate progress and status to the new team members. The vision statement and roadmap are not generally updated, unless there is a major change. Any slippage of milestones would be already included on an information radiator."
"A team is developing the human resource (HR) module of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. During a site visit, the client observes concerning data on the team’s information radiators. The burndown chart depicts the progress of the current 3-week iteration. The team is one-third of the way through the iteration, but the actual progress to date reflects the team is behind the planned progress.
 

 The client expresses concern and asks the team lead to discuss it with the product owner. How should the team lead respond?  A: Advise the client that no action is required because the team is in the middle of the iteration. B: Ask the product owner to address the performance issue and search for the cause during the daily standup meeting. C: Meet with each team member individually to see who is underperforming and find out what suggestions they may have to get the iteration back on track. D: Ask the product owner to identify stories that can be pulled out of the current iteration, so the team can meet the planned story points E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Fluctuation is expected during the sprint. There may be times that the team is behind (or ahead) of the plan. Since it is in the middle of an iteration, nothing needs to be done. At the end of the iteration, during the retrospective, the team should identify what went well and what improvements are needed."
"An experienced software developer is asked to lead a project for a customized software application for a client they have worked with previously. About 2 months into the project, the client wants to know how change is being managed and wants to see the project management plan. The team lead tells the client that this is an agile project; therefore, there is no project management plan! The client escalates this issue to the sponsor.  
 

 How should the sponsor respond to the client? A: Tell the client that the team lead is in charge and is able to manage the project however they wish. B: Tell the client that it is not in the contract to create such a document, and if it is required, they need to submit a change request. C: Tell the client that they will address the value and need for a project management plan with the team lead and ensure that they will have one to review and approve by a specific date. D: Ask the client what components of the project management plan are being requested. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Regardless of the project’s methodology, the project management plan is required. It outlines how every aspect of the project will be managed."
"A company is merging two similar projects. The extensive business processes from each project need to be merged. The team wants to optimize the merged business processes, and they hire a consultant to help them.
 

 How can the team ensure knowledge continuity from both projects? A: Instruct the consultant to optimize the processes. B: Create an archive from the projects so that team members can read it on their own. C: Instruct teams to create new templates for processes and begin using and improving them iteratively. D: Gather representatives from both teams to explore and define a mutually agreeable way of working (WoW). E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The best way to facilitate knowledge continuity from two merged sources is to create a benchmark quickly, prioritize the new way of working, and begin the work. When parties outside of the teams perform this work, the team members won't benefit from a first-hand experience. Archives are essential, of course, but creating them without mandating use often means that people rarely read them. Finally, creating new templates is a great idea, but that solution does not demonstrate a deliberate use of historical information, which is the point of knowledge transfer."
"A medical charity organization operates in disaster emergency zones worldwide. At headquarters, the leadership wants to ensure that their practitioners’ professional licenses are compliant with governing bodies both in the practitioner’s home and in their working locations. This is a condition set by their board of directors and the charity’s legal team.
 

 In order to facilitate the new measures, which three actions should be taken? (Choose three) A: Conduct an impact assessment and audit. B: Create and use an internal standard based on the most common international compliance standards. C: Evaluate the existing compliance status of all practitioners. D: Ensure signoff on compliance requirements from the board of directors and the legal team. E: Place the compliance risks in the risk register and mark them as low priority.","A, C, D - FEEDBACK: Conducting an audit, obtaining executive and legal approval, and creating a baseline or report on existing compliance status of practitioners are all ways to begin this process. Compliance is the charity’s responsibility, and non-compliance with legal matters is a high risk. Creating an internal standard may seem like an efficiency, but it exposes the charity to risk by not meeting any unique compliance requirements."
"A product owner receives some confidential security information that needs to be included in the definition of done or as part of the acceptance criteria. 
 

 How should the project leader categorize this requirement? A: Top-level management influence B: Omission from earlier in the process C: Compliance matter D: Change of heart E: ",C - FEEDBACK: This is an example of a compliance requirement. Security matters that are part of the definition of done or acceptance criteria are characteristic of compliance matters.
"During a sprint review, the team identified successful gains on planned improvements while noting that a lot more development and testing is required. The product owner wants to report on the business value of the work. 
 

 Which action should the team take to assist the product owner with validating business value? A: Conduct a variance analysis for the budget for the last iteration. B: Examine customer feedback. C: Plan to discuss it at the next retrospective. D: Measure earned value management (EVM). E: ",B - FEEDBACK: The best approach to obtain inputs about business value is talking directly with the customers and obtaining both quantitative and qualitative feedback.
"A team was assigned a project to build a new insurance policy administration system. After 6 months of project work, the project sponsor expresses concern. A colleague in an unrelated company division claims the policy administration system has bugs and the team is unable to solve critical problems. 
 

 Which two options should the project manager use to prepare a response to the project sponsor? (Choose two) A: Defect count B: A risk metric C: Issue log D: Changes E: Technical debt","A,C - FEEDBACK: You need to obtain data and report on quality and any obstacles affecting the project to explain problems to the project sponsor. A defect count will indicate the quality of the product being built as well as which areas of the product require more attention. The issue log will provide information about the obstacles. An issue log is a reporting tool that tracks errors in the project and organizes the current issues by type and severity to prioritize issues. A risk metric tool can identify threats to your project and put them in order of priority, while changes and technical debt will have to be considered, but only after you solve these critical issues."
"A project team lead has challenged the team to minimize defects and waste in project teamwork. As an initial step, the team proposes to assess the relevant quality standards and framework. 
 

 How can the team do this? A: Review the requirements management plan. B: Check the ISO.org website. C: Investigate the project quality metrics. D: Interview the person who manages quality compliance. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Quality metrics describe project or product attributes and provide details about how the team measures quality. The requirements management plan will give information and project requirements, NOT necessarily the details about the standards and frameworks about the project that is needed. The compliance manager and ISO.org will have more general information about quality standards."
"A project team is set to deliver a project in 12 months. The sponsor encourages innovation, and the project has a high risk tolerance. However, 8 months into the project, it is plagued with incomplete and failing prototypes. The highly capable team is feeling demoralized, and the project manager worries whether the deliverable will ever meet the stated acceptance criteria. 
 

 

 How would an adaptive life cycle have helped this project? A: The project sponsor would have been the product owner. B: Less paperwork and documentation are required. C: The desire for innovation and high risk tolerance are ideal for agile practices. D: Agile does not require acceptance criteria. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The benefit of agile to this project would have been the prioritization of innovation. With a high risk tolerance from the start, this is an ideal condition for use of the agile life cycle. While it’s true that “acceptance criteria” is not an agile concept, there is a definition of done, which is a similar premise. Whether the owner of the project is called a sponsor or a product owner would not indicate a greater level of involvement—both roles are still stakeholders who are focused on value. Though it could be considered a benefit, less paperwork is not a true benefit to realizing this project’s vision."
"A newly assembled project team is holding a kickoff meeting over a weekend. About half of the project team already works together; the other team members are contractors. 
 

 The company already uses lean and agile approaches. However, during the meeting, the team members openly argued about everything—from project goals to the smallest details. 
 

 Which action will help the team to build a shared understanding? A: Create breakout sessions and assign team members to specific work based on their expertise. B: Nominate someone to the role of project manager and adopt a hierarchical team structure. C: Ask the product owner to lead the session and explain to the team what to do. D: The team lead should arrange the team and contractors in working pairs. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: This team is in the storming phase, so arguments may be normal. However, they need to refocus and come together sooner rather than later. The team should collaborate, and at this stage the product owner is best qualified to offer some cohesion."
"A government is ready to announce a new tax on sugary products to fund a healthcare program. The team is working on the first set of goals to secure buy-in from the industry stakeholders and launch a strong public campaign to support the mandate. 
 

 In which three ways can the project build a shared understanding of the project goals with public stakeholders? (Choose three) A: Create partnerships between the government and industry stakeholders so that the industry is prepared to support the change. B: Launch a national survey program to anticipate how individuals and businesses will react. C: Announce the tax along with an advertising campaign to educate the country and individuals about the benefit. D: Inform industry stakeholders that noncompliant businesses will be penalized. E: Use an incremental approach by taxing products with the highest sugar content only and explain how this will improve health results over a period of time.","A, C, E - FEEDBACK: Projects do NOT always bring popular changes. There are many ways to approach stakeholder buy-in to a controversial problem. Proving the value of the project incrementally is one, if you have the time. Explaining the benefits to the skeptical customer is an empathetic approach, which is also valid. And involving key stakeholders in the premise of the change and allowing them to share in its success is a third possibility. Because the change will be difficult for stakeholders, just listening or gathering data is NOT enough."
"During an agile project, key stakeholders are expressing concerns about their lack of involvement. They feel disconnected from the project. The product owner agrees with these concerns and wishes to do something quickly. The iteration is coming to an end.
 

 What would be a good way to engage the key stakeholders at this stage? A: Arrange the daily stand-up on video, so all stakeholders can join the meeting. B: Arrange a meeting with the key stakeholders to discuss the iteration backlog. C: Invite the key stakeholders to join the next iteration planning meeting and the retrospective. D: Invite the key stakeholders to participate in the iteration review. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The best approach is to invite the stakeholders to take part in the review, as the iteration is almost completed. This is the most direct and appropriate option to involve the stakeholders."
"A product team has completed 8 of 10 planned iterations for a streamlining project. While refining the backlog for iteration nine, the product owner learns about a massive, company-wide budget change and sends this email: 
 

 Dear streamlining project team,
 

 The budget change announced yesterday will impact our project. I may need to reprioritize some of our planned work.
 

 How should the team lead respond?
  A: Reply with some recommendations to reduce the scope and still run two more iterations. B: Wait for the product owner to reprioritize the backlog. C: Contact the finance department to find out more about the budget cut. D: Disband the team, so they have time to find new assignments. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: This isn’t a reason to disband the team just yet! The product owner needs to reprioritize the backlog before the team begins work. The team cannot bypass the product owner and take independent action. The recommendations to reduce scope should be well received by the product owner, but the backlog still needs to be reprioritized--by the product owner."
"An agile team welcomes a new team member who is unfamiliar with the agile approach. At the weekly demo meeting, this team member becomes visibly nervous when an operations engineer, who often criticized their previous work, appears unexpectedly and gives very direct feedback about the prototype. After the meeting, the new team member leaves the room quickly. 
 

 How should the team respond? A: The product owner should approach the team member later in the day to find out the history of the problem. B: Allow the team members to figure out their own relationships since this is a self-organizing team. C: Hold a team meeting to find out from the other team members what they know about this situation. D: The team lead should reiterate the ground rules at the next retrospective meeting, especially the engagement protocols and communication standards. E: Facilitate a face-to- Face meeting between the new team member and the operations engineer","B, D - FEEDBACK: Agile teams are self-organizing and need to negotiate healthy relationships. The team lead, as an important member of the scrum team, has a key role to play in maintaining the team's decorum and maintaining healthy relationships. Given this scenario, it is far too early to force an intervention. Self-organization is a process of finding agreeable working relationships."
"A product owner is reviewing notes from the latest stakeholder meeting.
 

 Which two note items should the product owner consider as changes to the product backlog? (Choose two) A: Recommendation from stakeholder M to change a task in the current iteration. B: Team member wrote their brilliant new idea on a yellow sticker and put it on the kanban board. C: Unprioritized user story—stakeholder B wants new and improved quality requirements! D: Issue—but the team has this under control. E: Bug fixes/technical debt","B, C - FEEDBACK: Include any new ideas and changes to existing content in the product backlog because they require further action. Changes to the current iteration will be handled by the team as they are working. The issue is being handled by the team, so requires no further priority or action. Bug fixes or technical debt issues are typically included in a final iteration focused on quality."
"A critical project to improve a customer service process has failed. Even though all the end users were trained on the new service, they rejected the change and continued using their original process. 
 

 Which of the following actions should the team take? A: Escalate the lack of cooperation to the end users' functional manager. B: Take note of the risks associated with the new implementation. C: Engage the end user community and try to understand their concerns. D: Repackage and execute the original plan. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: This team needs to understand customer needs and desires better. Their cooperation and buy-in to this critical project are the most important success factors. The risk of stakeholder rejection should already have been noted! It is too late for that risk to be managed now. Escalation is an over-reaction, and repackaging the original plan will cause the same problems to reoccur."
"A team lead receives an email from the product owner asking for a more precise view of actual time spent on tasks to apply more accurate business value estimates in the product backlog. The team is extremely busy, and deadlines are tight.
 

 How should the team lead answer this request? A: Make sure the team is updating the burndown chart daily, so the product owner has an accurate view of the work completed. B: Ask the product owner to supply the team with more specific and detailed user stories so they can understand the customer value desired better. C: Explain that flexible estimating units enable the team to accelerate delivery of business value. D: State that the team is extremely busy and can’t help right now. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: The team needs to keep the product owner updated on the completion of work, and the burndown chart is a daily work measurement tool that most teams use. The product owner should already communicate with the team about development through detailed user stories; it is the product owner’s responsibility to monitor value, NOT the team’s. The product owner should already know why they use flexible estimating units. Communication between project stakeholders should always be cordial and team- Focused, no matter how stressful the situation."
"The agile team has identified a lot of risks and issues, but the notes seem to be a bit unclear. Which two of the following are risks? (Choose two) A: The burndown chart is unclear; it has not been updated. B: The new DevOps toolchain may be ready during this iteration. C: The vision statement is misunderstood, resulting in flawed requirements. D: The tech lead for the project has resigned from the company. E: A senior VP has indicated that there are additional requirements.","B, C - FEEDBACK: A risk includes an uncertainty and can be positive or negative while issues have already happened and are negative. The unclear burndown chart, resignation, and news of additional requirements are events that have already happened."
"A project manager shifts to an agile approach for a project with an aggressive go-to-market time line. The project manager needs to revise the stakeholder engagement plan so that it follows agile principles.
  
 Which action should the project manager take? A: Increase the number of formal training workshops to cover all relevant issues for all stakeholders, including the project sponsor and client. B: Increase the number of stakeholder communication channels. C: Make standup meetings mandatory for all key stakeholders D: Update the stakeholder engagement matrix. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The stakeholder engagement matrix needs updating in this case, specifically how the stakeholders are engaged. All of the other answers create complexity. Agile includes the ability of stakeholders and team members to have direct access to each other to improve communication, values transparency, and strips away unnecessary layers or formalities."
"A project manager is working on a data center migration project and is developing the schedule management plan. The project was planned to last 40 days and the project sponsor wants it done in 35. 
  
 Which action should the project manager take to amend this schedule for the new requirement?  A: Crash activities that are NOT on the critical path. B: Increase duration of the critical path. C: Use leads. 
  D: Use lags. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The project manager should use leads to reduce the interval time for the revised schedule. Leads involve starting a successor activity before the predecessor activity has finished. By identifying lead times, this project manager can adapt activity schedules to shorten the original schedule to 35 days. When using leads, the logical relationship between activities must have a discretionary finish-to-start or start-to-start dependency.
 

 Lags are required delays in the start of successor activities and are used in case of physical or resource constraints, to wait for another activity to fully or partially finish or for certain dates and events to happen. Increasing the duration of the critical path extends the duration of the project, and crashing activities that are not on the critical path can introduce risks to the project."
"A new product is released by a company. When a customer identifies performance issues with the product, the project manager investigates and realizes that the cost of quality (COQ) methodology should have been used to estimate this cost.
  
 Assuming the customer has identified an issue, which category of COQ should the project manager be referring to? A: Prevention costs B: External costs C: Appraisal costs D: Cost-benefit analysis E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The Cost of Quality includes all costs associated with the quality of a product from preventive costs intended to reduce or eliminate failures, cost of process controls to maintain quality levels, and the costs related to both internal and external failures. In this case, the customer has found a fault, so the project manager should look in to external failure costs. Prevention activities typically involve addressing a specific recurring problem within the project. Appraisal costs include activities such as inspections, tests, and audits designed to ensure consistent quality and conformance to established procedures. The cost-benefit analysis tool compares the costs and effects of different approaches."
"A product owner is collaborating with the team lead to refine the product backlog. They need a better way to prioritize the backlog because the current stakeholders could not agree while using the MoSCoW technique. The product owner decides to create a matrix and identified ""value"" as the first axis.
 

 Which two items could work for the second axis? (Choose two)
  A: Risk B: Effort C: Quality D: Time E: Impact","A,B - FEEDBACK: Value and either risk or effort are valid and useful measures to enable prioritization. While prioritization is essential for all projects, agile projects are time-boxed with a fixed set of resources, so prioritization is required in order to accommodate the time and budget constraints in order to produce value. This prioritization process, using value and then either risk or effort, will help the team to consider which items on the backlog will create the most value with the least amount of risk or effort."
"An organization’s policy states any change requested on a project that exceeds a certain amount and/or complexity must adhere to the organizational policy and procedures. 
 

 The project manager just received an urgent change request (CR) from the customer, and they want it added to the change control board (CCB) agenda scheduled for tomorrow. However, the CR is incomplete.
 

 What should the project manager do? A: Begin additional analysis of the CR. B: Put it on the CCB agenda for tomorrow and address it there. C: Return the CR to the customer because it is incomplete. D: Approve the change request. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: The project manager needs to do additional analysis to fill in the missing pieces of the CR before any action on it can be taken. All projects must adhere to organizational policies and procedures. The project leader should be open and transparent with the client. Furthermore, this should be clearly spelled out in the project management plan."
"A construction project to build a luxury skyscraper is coming to an end. In advance of the handoff, the management team has been trained to take charge of all aspects of maintaining the building. The lead engineer from the development team expresses concern. During construction, substantial new technologies were introduced, and the engineering team learned new skills. 
 

 What is the best way for the team to handle knowledge transfer in this case? A: Set up a contract for the engineering team to continue as consultants. B: Require the engineering team to record their knowledge and make this available to the management team. C: Set up additional training for the management team and include the engineering development team as key stakeholders. D: Conduct root-cause analysis (RCA) to determine the problem and set action items to resolve them. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The best way forward in this case is a dynamic training situation in which the engineering team can interact with the management team to identify and hand off the information that will be critical for them. The engineers possess the expert knowledge about the new technology in the skyscraper, but they may NOT possess the information required from a management point of view. So the training itself needs to be tailored to meet the needs of the receiving party. This is preferable to an ongoing consultancy because it is a formal and dedicated training exercise. Recording knowledge is always important, but only the first step in sharing. The act of sharing and engagement constitutes knowledge transfer. Finally, a root-cause analysis unnecessarily widens the scope of needed action here."
"A key team member has been offered a new opportunity and will be leaving the project team. The team is looking for a replacement but is unable to find anyone with the same level of skill. This team member has been with the project since it began, which was over 1 year ago, and has a lot of knowledge and skills that other team members lack. 
 

 Which two actions should the team take to ensure project continuity? (Choose two) A: Create a new work item in the product backlog to interview the departing team member and record the sessions. B: Discuss the risk of a key dependency’s resignation in the next team retrospective. C: Inform the team member’s manager that unless they find someone soon, it could be detrimental to the project. D: Schedule knowledge transfer sessions with the departing team member. E: Ask the departing team member to nominate existing team members who seem to have the best skills for certain tasks.","A,D - FEEDBACK: Important project knowledge should be stored and accessible for the team. Knowledge can be explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge can be documented easily and stored. But tacit information benefits from discussion and elaboration between project team members--a recorded interview with the team member and subsequent knowledge transfer sessions."
"Company H is completing a merger and has acquired several valuable assets from company Z that require specialist care, including intellectual property rights and museum artifacts. The team is conflicted about what to do, but the product owner has identified knowledge transfer—to ensure the new organization can maintain the collections properly—as one of the highest priorities for the merger. 
 

 Which two of the following actions should the team take? (Choose two) A: Pair leaders from each of the critical business elements in both companies for collaboration. B: Hold daily standup meetings to discuss the new roadmap. C: Post updates in the monthly status report. D: Hire specialists in intellectual property rights and museum management to lead a formal transfer. E: Create a backlog item to insure the artifacts and property that are most valuable.","A,D - FEEDBACK: Pairing new team members and hiring specialists, in this case, are the best ways to transfer specialist knowledge successfully. Ensuring the safety of the collections will be helpful, but this tool won't ensure the teams learn how to maintain the collections. Daily stand-ups are too short to properly share knowledge; they are intended for daily planning and brief updates. Monthly status updates are not sufficient to conduct specialist knowledge transfer."
"A global organization is headquartered in a country that has just passed a law making it illegal for employers to contact employees outside of office hours. Because 85% of the employees live in this country, and the leadership team launched an initiative in employee wellness, the company has adopted the policy across the whole organization. 
 

 However, just this weekend, the director of marketing sent an urgent email to the entire team demanding that they correct a mistake on the project prototype, ASAP! Two team members sent messages with a tone of panic to the team lead’s personal phone.
 

 How should the team lead respond? A: Remind the director that the team is not required to work outside of office hours. B: Contact human resources (HR) and escalate this matter. They are all violating the new law and company policy. C: Do nothing until Monday. D: Assure the director that the team will address the problem next week and tell the team members who messaged to have a nice weekend. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: While you have every legal right to do nothing until Monday, this is a new policy, and your team members are panicked. Respond to both parties quickly and get back to your weekend! Respond to the director about the project only; you are not the enforcer of organizational policies. It will take a while for everyone to adopt the new rules, so escalation is an overreaction."
"A project team is building a pedestrian sky bridge across a major river. Some technical project team members are highly experienced with mega infrastructure projects. However, the team also includes many junior trainees who have little experience. This variance in team experience is listed as a risk that could affect team working conditions and safety, as well as the project build quality.
 

 At the team’s morning status meeting, a facilitator led a discussion about continuous improvement and asked the team how leadership and the company could help them improve. 
 

 The team listed the five following answers. Which two actions can help this team improve? (Choose two) A: Hire experienced workers next time. B: Communicate team goals better. C: Have more team meetings. D: Provide more learning opportunities. E: Offer a remote working option and upgrade laptops.","B,D - FEEDBACK: Teams need to openly communicate about improving their processes, skills, and knowledge. If the team asked for better communication of goals, then something is missing in the current communication. More meetings won’t guarantee better communication of goals, nor will upgrading technology or changing to remote work improve the team effort or project build quality. This team is already composed of junior and senior members who need to learn how to work together better for the sake of the project, to mitigate the safety and quality risks, and to improve professionally. Therefore, learning opportunities for this team are appropriate."
"A global volunteer organization operates a continuous training model to improve the knowledge of all volunteers and members. They design custom training on a wide range of topics and deliver it virtually on the third Friday of every month. 
 

 The team in charge of training brainstorms a list of ideas to check if the training is effective and adequate. 
 

 Which item on this list will help determine the effectiveness of this training? A: Give trainees a pre-assessment. B: Monitor how many people had their cameras on during the training. C: Survey people about their areas of interest. D: Perform a statistical sampling of attendees to find out what they learned. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The only way to know if your continuous improvement program is working is to measure. Quizzes, surveys, metrics, or sampling are measurement methods. Watching attendees on a screen will NOT give you an effectiveness measurement. It could actually have a negative effect on the uptake of the training."
"After months of information gathering and meeting with the community, a police force wants to design and launch an app to improve the quality of communication with members of the public, one of their critical stakeholders. 
 

 How is this an example of continuous process improvement? A: People who use the app will automatically receive monthly updates about community initiatives. B: The app development will be a separate agile track, which shows that the police force is using good project management. C: It is intended to improve efficiency and quality of communication between the police and members of the public. D: Crime rates will decline. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: This app is an example of an organization taking notable improvement steps in one of its own internal critical processes—in this case, to improve stakeholder communication, which should create broader benefits."
"A highly engaged agile team is forced to halt business operations when a major crisis occurs, closing offices and requiring employees to work remotely. 
 

 Many team members who were high-performing contributors before the crisis are missing daily standups or attending meetings but turning their cameras off and not participating. Because of poor attendance, the project is not meeting sprint goals. Consequently, the project is not performing well. 
 

 Which action is the most effective way to motivate the team? A: Skip the retrospectives to give people more time to work. B: Award the consistent top contributors with a gift card at the next meeting to incentivize the others. C: Send emails to absent team members requiring a written response on progress and give them negative feedback during their performance reviews. D: Keep your camera on to lead by example and use an agenda that actively involves people in the meeting. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: In a stressful situation such as this one, a supportive environment is critical—as critical as moving the project forward. You can coach and reinforce a positive team method, lead with accountability and constructive feedback, and be a servant leader to set an example. But you probably should NOT reward others in this case. Absent team members may have a variety of challenging circumstances to negotiate."
"A project team member is consistently missing deadlines, creating bottlenecks for the rest of the team. 
 

 Which action should the team take to support the team member? A: Enroll the team member in time management training B: Ask the team member to speak first at standups C: Release the team member D: Pair the team member with a more experienced member of the team E: ","D - FEEDBACK: While all of these solutions can work and produce a better result for the team and the team member. The best answer in this scenario is to try pairing, which is a coaching situation that can support this team member by revealing competency needs, specifically how to perform tasks in a more timely manner."
"A project manager is assessing the risks to a hybrid project in the execution stage. At the end of each iteration, the team has only reported normal issues such as equipment malfunctions. However, the team has recently alerted the project manager to a developing problem that signal regulatory noncompliance for the product.
 

 Which artifact should the project manager review and update? A: Risk register B: Probability/impact matrix C: Risk management plan D: Product technical documentation E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Since noncompliance is a known risk area, the project manager can find information related to the management of this risk in the risk register. The probability/impact matrix will provide details of the consequences of the risk, so this will be useful after the risk has been assessed. The risk management plan and the technical documentation will contain helpful information, but not at this stage, when the project manager simply needs to know if the developing problem has escalated and poses the threat of becoming an issue."
"A PMO in a large manufacturing company has been working diligently to retrain project managers and standardize software and templates across all projects, so that every project in the company will produce compliant artifacts. Which type of PMO is being described? A: Supporting B: Controlling C: Directive D: Agile Center of Excellence E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. Compliance may involve adopting project management frameworks or methodologies; using specific templates, forms and tools; or conforming to governance. Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information and lessons learned from other projects. Directive PMOs take control of projects by directly managing the projects or shared resources, including project managers. A relatively small number of PMOs fall into this category. Agile Centers of Excellence (ACoE) or Value Delivery Offices (VDO) are emerging within organizations adopting more decentralized structures where teams need to respond quickly to changing customer needs. Their role is different, taking on coaching and mentoring efforts, rather than a managerial one."
"Two project managers are chatting in an airport lounge, on their way to a conference. They have never met and work in different companies. Project manager A tells a story about the last project, in which the team was given strict deadlines for updating artifacts and were audited to ensure risk registers and issue logs were updated at least once per week. Project manager B is shocked by project manager A’s story, because their project team is allowed to work independently, with very little reporting required.
 

 Which statement is true? A: Project manager B’s PMO has no project governance. B: Project manager B’s company does not have a PMO. C: Project manager B’s company uses adaptive development approaches that projects adhere to and the PMO ensures compliance. D: Project manager B’s company has a supportive PMO which only provides a peripheral role. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Clearly, these two project managers work in different contexts. Project manager B’s company has a PMO that ensures compliance, but otherwise empowers project teams to self-organize and run adaptive projects."
"The CEO of a global furniture chain authorizes a project to retrofit 35% of the company’s factories with new technology in 2 years, at a maximum cost of $US48 million. The competition in this market is high and the CEO needs to see a return on the investment within 3 years.
 

 Which development approach should this project take and why? A: A predictive development approach, because the scope, budget and schedule are set B: A hybrid development approach that uses a predictive scheduling process and incremental development of the factories to ensure the value-based expenditure of the budget and resources C: A hybrid development approach that uses time-boxed, iterative scheduling with incremental budget releases over the 2-year period; this will ensure the project does not run out of money D: A hybrid development approach with a flexible scope, in case anything changes and the company can pivot E: ",B - FEEDBACK: A hybrid approach with a predictive scheduling process and incremental development of the work will show the CEO how the project is proving value while controlling the budget and time line.
"An international bank is performing a merger as part of a major program change and hired a consulting company to perform an advisory role during the merger. The consultants recommend using agile to ensure the best chance of success.
 

 What do the consultants mean by this? A: They need to work quickly. B: Use of agile practices to complete financial mergers is a best practice. C: Adopting the agile mindset helps organizations navigate complexity. D: The merger should be completed in increments. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Agile practices are helpful in incremental and rapid development, and they are informed by the agile mindset, which is a group of four values and 12 principles about how to think and behave within the practice of agile methods. When project professionals refer to “being agile,” they are referring to the mindset, which bears the characteristics of the life cycle of the same name."
"A virtual team member has recently joined a colocated team. Despite being highly qualified, the team member’s performance is constantly questioned and ridiculed by the collocated team members. 
 

 Which approach should the team lead take? A: Use the team charter to address collaboration and team goals B: Cancel the virtual team member’s contract; clearly, the team is not cohesive.
  C: Organize a weekly virtual coworking session led by a facilitator. D: Monitor the situation and intervene only if the virtual team member makes a report to HR. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: The team lead needs to empower this team to self-organize and address the risk of isolation and bullying the new virtual team member is experiencing. Using the team charter to address collaboration and team goals will remind everyone of the common aims, professionalism, and appropriate conduct they seem to have forgotten."
"In an organization, some people work longer days in a 4-day week, while others work standard days 5 days per week. On one project, a mix of these schedules has caused some scheduling problems, particularly for standups and iteration demos. 
 

 Which approach should the team take? A: Require the team members who work 4-day weeks to attend the standups on day five. B: Self-organize and solve its scheduling problem. C: Suggest that everyone on the team use the same work week during this project. D: Ask the PMO for advice. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The team needs to make some tough choices here, but they have to be agreeable to everyone. They could agree about how to share information with members who couldn’t attend or hold a standup at the end of the last working day of the 4-day week. Whatever choice they make, agreement in the team charter and a shared perception of work is key."
"A team member has reported a project manager to HR for shouting during meetings. Other team members validate the complaint, but when the PMO asked the project manager about this, their answer was they were only trying to motivate the team. 
 

 What is the problem here? A: The team members are too sensitive. B: The project manager needs to be a servant leader. C: The team charter lacks details about polite conduct. D: The project manager is unqualified. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: There could be many reasons for this conflict on the team, but project professionals, as part of their roles as leaders, must exercise appropriate interpersonal skills as servant leaders. Some teams and situations are extremely sensitive; project managers should be able to adapt to lead any kind of team or personality. Clearly, the project manager understands the need to motivate the team, but the question is how to do this in the right way. This is the opportunity presented by servant leadership, to understand how to effectively lead this team by example. Clearly, the team members are indicating their dissatisfaction with the project manager’s current method. Team charters cannot contain detail about every type of communication and expectation on a team."
"A project manager meets frequently with a company’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) coordinator, because several members of the project team wear t-shirts on Fridays that others in the organization consider controversial. They are allowed to wear the shirts, but there are numerous complaints from around the company.
 

 What should the project manager do first? A: Caution the team members about wearing the t-shirts to work. B: Coach the team members on self-awareness. C: Continue meeting with the DE&I coordinator. D: Find out why they are wearing the t-shirts. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Understanding the cultural contexts of the organization, its larger culture(s), and the individuals involved is essential in choosing the right course of action here. If the team members were not allowed to wear the shirts in the first place, then the easy answer is discipline. But since the team is permitted to wear the shirts, this potentially difficult situation risks getting a bit worse each Friday. The best course of action is to coach the team members on how to be more self-aware so they can understand how their actions may be causing others distress, even though the t-shirts are allowed. This answer is more transformational than any of the others and will provide better, longer lasting results."
"A virtual project team has been working together for a month. During this time, they have bonded a little, and then at an in-person team-building day, they finally meet each other. At this meeting, the team decides they would like to make a change to the weekly status meeting ground rules and include a little time for socializing. They think it will help to ease the feelings of isolation many of them express. The current team charter states that status team meetings are to be used for work purposes only.
 

 What should the project manager do first? A: Allow the team to schedule a separate meeting during work hours for socializing. B: Change the ground rules to allow socializing during the first 10 minutes only of weekly status meetings. C: Schedule another collocated team-building event soon. D: Poll team members to measure support for changing the ground rules. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: For a change to the ground rules, the team’s consensus is key. All of the other choices are definitely possible but will impact the project negatively. A separate meeting would risk taking team focus away during working hours; changing the ground rules and limiting it would seem autocratic; another team-building event would be costly in time and money."
"A project team is brainstorming a complex issue with the prototype in development. They have consulted numerous experts in the field and together, have narrowed down the choice of possible actions to two.
 

 How should the team decide which action to take?
  A: Empower the team lead to choose. B: Choose based on lower cost. C: Use the Delphi technique. D: Review the project management plan. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: This team is cohesive and is doing the right things to problem-solve. They have already consulted the experts, as this is what the Delphi technique calls for, so there is reason to think they can continue to employ this unanimous decision-making method of consulting experts and arriving at a course of action based on their advice."
"A racing team has just finished a season and is preparing for next season. The owners think they should change the way the business works to make the company more efficient and have better control over outcomes and budget. The team engineers want to continue researching and running highly experimental design and technology developments. The racing team has hired a project manager for consultation.
 

 What should the project manager recommend? A: Ask the owners to adopt a “fail fast” mindset to follow the lead of the engineers. B: Ask the project team to identify areas for potential efficiencies using methods like Monte Carlo simulation. C: Suggest the adoption of a company-wide cultural transformation based on the agile mindset that will foster holistic improvements. D: Suggest initiation of a project based on achieving the business departments’ objectives and key results (OKRs). E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The conflict between control and innovation is common in business settings. The agile mindset and methodologies propose a way of providing a means to doing both simultaneously and in partnership. Without a culture change, this organization may continue to perceive that control by the owners is incompatible with innovation."
"An agile project team is working in an environment that is experiencing significant and disruptive upheaval. Team members are not performing well due to the stress, but work must continue.  
 

 What should the team do? A: Rely on the agile coach to focus the team on desired outcomes. B: Ask the product owner to add time to the schedule. C: Continue working as normal. D: Examine project closure or cancellation options. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: If work must continue, then the answer is finding a way to focus on the work. Extending deadlines or pretending nothing is wrong can be risky. Examining project closure options may be a bit drastic at this stage."
"A project team is working in a remote location, and its operability is threatened due to severe supply chain disruption. This risk was listed in the risk register, but the severity of the disruption was not accounted for, so guidance on the response is minimal. 
 

 What should the team do first? A: Seek expert judgment on the matter and revise the risk response B: Focus on maintaining team coherence C: Cancel the project D: Escalate to an organizational resource that can help E: ","A - FEEDBACK: External enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) can often take us by surprise and pose serious threats, even with careful planning. In this case, the team should rely on expert judgment to figure out how to continue working as well as possible, given the difficult circumstances."
"A project team relies on work with an overseas contractor. For years, this contractor accepted payment in the team’s currency, but have now notified the team’s company that after next month, future payments must be made in the contractor’s local currency. 
 

 How can the team deal with this problem with the least disruption to the team? A: Do the work themselves B: Suggest using a fixed price with economic price adjustments contract C: Switch vendors D: Renegotiate the contract rate, including a percentage contingency for fluctuating exchange rates E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Fixed price contracts with economic price adjustments allow for special provisions for predefined final adjustments to the contract price — e.g., inflation, cost increases (or decreases) for specific commodities. They are ideal for preapproved vendors or those who require international payments and are far more straightforward than accounting for fluctuating exchange rates."
"An agile team is deployed to create a workable solution for helping a region with contaminated water supply. They are working with the government, contractors, and local residents to find the right technology to solve the problem. The product owner is trying to determine the urgency of the problem.
 

 How can the team help the product owner? A: Research the market and make a list of available technologies. B: Work with the local stakeholders to find out how much they are affected. C: Determine the cost of a few solutions. D: Find out how many people are affected. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: The customers in this project are the local stakeholders, and the team is responsible for finding out their needs and desired outcomes. The cost, available technologies, and number of people affected will determine the course of action, but the required sense of urgency can only be known by asking those affected."
"A project in a university to create a seed bank is complete. It was the first project used in the organization to use an agile approach. The deliverables were identified by the product owner. Some of the stakeholders are concerned about quality and have not signed off on the deliverables. 
 

 What is the best way to collect feedback on the definition of done (DoD)? A: Create a temporary wiki site for stakeholders to provide anonymous feedback. B: Review all the lessons learned to evaluate strategic alignment. C: Send a satisfaction survey and then set up a focus group. D: Conduct a product review meeting with the concerned stakeholders. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Direct and regular feedback from stakeholders is a normal feature of agile development approaches. Since this is the organization’s first agile project, the stakeholders may not realize how the process relates to quality in an ongoing and continuous way. The best approach is to meet with them and review the product. Agile recommends face-to- Face contact and colocation whenever possible."
"A project team has just successfully completed development of an underwater exploration device, which has cost more than $US3 billion to deliver. The company immediately orders five more units to be delivered, but with a budget of $US1 billion. The stakeholders' reason for the reduced budget was since the technology has been developed, the project can be funded for building costs primarily, with a small amount for troubleshooting or development work. The stakeholders’ priority is to recoup some financial value from the first project. 
 

 How should the team and the product owner approach this situation? A: Research the risk associated with the low budget for this work and present this to the stakeholders. B: Explore with the stakeholders less risky ways to gain financial value from the first project. C: Create a story map for the proposed development with the risks clearly accounted for in the work items. D: Include a feature that addresses the risk approach to this work. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Since the stakeholders’ priority is to recoup financial value from a previous project, their focus is on the money. You need to speak directly to them about the money, in this case how the low budget presents a risk that could create serious problems. Exploring other options will not address an additional risk inherent in this scenario—that of unrealistic stakeholder expectations. Both of these are part of the steward's role in the project."
"A project team is worried about product packaging and presentation. They receive a lot of negative feedback about this during iteration demos. 
 

 How can the team improve their chances of customer acceptance? A: Look through the customer’s social media accounts and perform a qualitative analysis of customer attitudes towards packaging. B: Investigate changes in the external business environment related to consumer attitudes about packaging. C: Revise the definition of done (DoD) with the customer. D: Find better options for packaging. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Finding better packaging is definitely the goal in this scenario, but it’s a question of how! Teams can research and recommend, and while project teams should always be aware of how external changes could impact their project, the customer is the first place to start to determine the criteria for what they will accept. The definition of done (DoD) must be agreed and updated to customer needs—and this is subject to change in an adaptive project!"
"A company executive who is not a key project stakeholder of a project has expressed continued interest and opinions directly to the project team. The key stakeholders are becoming annoyed and perceive the executive to be interfering and causing unwanted noise, but the project team finds the executive’s inputs helpful.
 

 What should the team do first? A: Ask the product owner to intervene in the conflict. B: Add this executive to the team as a key stakeholder. C: Discuss what should happen at the next retrospective. D: Use Speed B Leas conflict management techniques. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: There is a lot happening here that could be beneficial to the project but could also be harmful—the existing stakeholders could feel threatened, or the scope could be changing from what the stakeholders envisioned with the executive’s inputs. The team needs to decide what to do, but with a clear consensus and expert judgment before taking action. A retrospective is about gaining insights for team improvement. All of the options could likely happen as well, but the first thing to do is discuss with the team. If the team agrees that further engagement is desirable, then the team could move on to reclassification of the stakeholder and any resulting conflict management."
"An executive in the company who is not a key project stakeholder of a project has expressed continued interest in the project and frequently gives their opinions directly to the project team. The key stakeholders are becoming annoyed and perceive the executive to be interfering, but the project team finds the executive’s inputs helpful.
 

 Which two options are present in this situation? (Choose two) A: An intractable/war situation, in the Leas conflict model B: A potential conflict C: Escalation required D: An opportunity E: An impediment","B,D - FEEDBACK: There is a potential conflict here between the key stakeholders and the executives – and also with the team. However, there is an opportunity present in the helpfulness of the executive’s inputs."
"The executives, managers and coaches of a professional sports team often disagree. On a current project to create a VIP perks program, the product owner gets wildly conflicting inputs from the stakeholders ––9 executives, managers and coaches. The product owner who is new to the organization asks the team for help on making decisions to create the initial product backlog. 
 

 What should the team do? A: Meet with the stakeholders to brainstorm, allow stakeholders to give their opinions and use active listening and expert judgment to note areas of agreement for use in creating user stories. B: Interview the stakeholders separately and then the team and product owner can make the decisions. C: Hold a kickoff meeting with all stakeholders, present the conflicting points of view and take notes on the whiteboard. These will become user stories. D: Since the stakeholders can’t agree, send them individual surveys to collect data, then write user stories and use voting techniques to prioritize them. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Conflict is a part of decision-making, and it can be an important source of ideation in groups. Especially in an organizational culture that has a lot of inherent conflict, stakeholders may be accustomed to conflict as part of the culture. The kickoff meeting is not the place to resolve problems."
"An agile project team is working on improvements to the user experience (UX) for an online newspaper. The team thinks this is a fairly low-risk project, so they forgo a risk assessment and start working. The product owner disagrees and commissions a risk assessment. 
 

 Which statement is correct about this scenario? A: Project risk is everyone’s responsibility, and the team should not have skipped the risk assessment. B: The risk assessment will be completed, so everything is fine. C: If the team is correct, the product owner is wasting time and resources. D: Risk assessment is the product owner’s responsibility. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: Risk is everywhere and inherent in every project or activity. Project risk is everyone’s responsibility. The team, the product owner and the stakeholders should be aware of the various risks of the project in relation to its environment. Whether the risk assessment is a formal or informal method depends on the project context, but some form of risk assessment must be done."
"A company initiates a project to replace aging infrastructure by adopting an emerging green technology. The team is forming and having initial conversations about how to approach the project.
 

 Which three of the following will be helpful to the team? (Choose three) A: Benefits management plan B: Business case C: Initial risk assessment D: Benefit-cost analysis E: Team charter","B,C,E - FEEDBACK: The most helpful assets to a newly forming team on a project with high risk are the business case, an initial risk assessment and the team charter. These documents state why the business needs or wants the project and helps determine the resources needed, the inherent risk in undertaking the project, and the terms of working together. The benefit-cost analysis helps compare the proposed benefits to the costs—so this is useful a bit later on. The benefits management plan should start to be formed at this stage, but this is a summary of what the expected benefits are from updating the infrastructure and adopting the new technology, as well as how they will be delivered to and measured by the business."
"A tech startup has four projects authorized and running: 
 

 1. Customer experience (CX) app development with executive stakeholders
 2. Third-party app development with new vendors
 3. Project with global team members who speak six languages
 4. Game development using experimental technology
 

 Which statement about risk and quality is correct?
  A: All of these projects contain the same risk and are subject to the same quality standards because they are in the same organization. B: These projects all contain inherent risk and require unique quality metrics. C: The project using experimental technology has the highest level of risk and quality standards. D: The quality requirements for technology depend on external regulations. So the multilingual project team presents the lowest risk. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Each project has unique risk and quality requirements and contexts, and they can rarely be compared with one another--even if they are in the same organization!"
"A project manager for a major annual international sporting event is reviewing data collected after the second of six planned project phases and sees that the team is performing poorly. The project uses a hybrid management model, with a project manager and decentralized decision-making at the team level. The project manager learns that several critical elements are behind schedule, and some delivered services are not operating correctly, resulting in rework and more delays. Also, team members might be enjoying working with the sports teams and being in the media spotlight a bit too much.
 

  
 What should the project manager do? A: Continue to allow the team to make decisions and self-organize around work. B: Review performance data and reinforce project goals with the team at the soonest opportunity. C: Log the performance issues in the issue log and assign team members to identify and execute solutions. D: Coach team members about prioritizing work over having fun. E: ","B - FEEDBACK: Some real warning signs are present in this scenario—delays, rework, poor quality, and the team’s distracted work ethic. Though it is early in the project time line, these problems could worsen or compound. Coaching or doing nothing are risky decisions. It is time to intervene in a way that still enables the team to make decisions. Option B, in which the project manager meets with the team to review performance data and reinforce project goals, still empowers the team to take action to correct mistakes and get the project back on track. Logging the issues in the issue log would also be appropriate; however, taking the team’s empowerment away by assigning team members is not the best decision."
"A large project team for a major annual event is reforming with all the same team members. To prepare for the preliminary meeting with the team, the newly assigned project manager reviews the lessons learned repository and sees this highlighted comment: “Team members were distracted at the live matches. The team leads were ineffective at redirecting team member effort.”
 

 How should the project manager approach this situation? A: Replace the team leads from the previous year with stronger, experienced team leads. B: Coach the team members from the previous year about professionalism at the live matches. C: Establish clearer ground rules with the team and team leads, including disciplinary actions for breaches. D: Implement appropriate behavior guidelines and penalties for team members at live matches. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: This team needs improved ground rules. The project manager should recognize that the team’s behavior may not change unless something forces it to change--and establishing clearer ground rules can do this. Because the project manager is new, coaching team members about past behavior will seem theoretical to them; the team leads need to be coached as well! Deselecting team leads or implementing guidelines and penalties seems too heavy-handed for a new project manager. The goal is to create a positive dynamic with this new team so they do not make the same mistakes again."
"To prepare for this year’s major international sporting event which will be broadcasted live on every continent, the project manager arranges professional media training for key members of the project team and stakeholders. Stakeholder A, who is outspoken and extremely active in the media, is not taking the training class seriously. The facilitator reports the issue by email, stating “I can’t work with this trainee anymore!” 
 

 What should the project manager do? A: Continue the training and log the issue with stakeholder A. B: Attend the next session to confirm the facilitator’s reported issue. C: Coach stakeholder A about their attitude and redo their training. D: Meet with stakeholder A to determine how to better meet their training needs. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Each stakeholder has different needs. In terms of training, this guideline is no exception, and a project manager must approach this situation with objectivity. Stakeholder A may need more or less training than the others, or a different kind of training. Because the facilitator already seems to have formed a negative opinion of stakeholder A, their relationship might be damaged. Start by prioritizing your stakeholder to understand their needs, even if they are behaving in a difficult way."
"A project to build houses is halfway complete and is meeting projected budget and schedule metrics for phase 1. The project manager receives news that the project will only receive 40% of the funding committed for phase 2, but all the houses must be completed. In collaboration with stakeholders, the project manager develops three possible ways forward, which are summarized as follows: 
 

 Stakeholder A: Revise the scope because the financial situation could worsen.
 Stakeholder B: Use to an incremental development approach to complete the foundation work on the remaining units and seek new finance options. I have a few leads already! We can add this work as a new phase 3.
 Stakeholder C: We should choose the least risky option.
 

 

 

 Using the given stakeholder power/influence grid and the summaries, which action should the project manager take? A: Follow stakeholder B’s suggestion because this is the most important stakeholder.
  B: Follow stakeholder A’s suggestion because it is the least risky.
  C: Examine the options given by stakeholders B and C alongside the business’s strategic goals and value needs. D: Conduct a risk analysis of the options given by stakeholders A and B. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: The project manager’s role is to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure positive project outcomes. In this case, the project manager needs to deliver the value (completed houses) and balance risk, as the stakeholders A and C have indicated. Stakeholder C's input does not show a way forward, though it indicates the importance of risk management. The options given by stakeholders B and C should be examined alongside the business goals and value delivery requirements. Stakeholder B has the greatest power and influence, as indicated by their placement in the upper-right quadrant of the stakeholder matrix. However, that does not mean that this opinion should automatically be given the highest priority. Stakeholder C’s place marker indicates a greater degree of power than that of stakeholder A, so choosing the least risky option is more important than what stakeholder A suggests. In fact, stakeholder A’s suggestion may hold great risk, finishing all the houses with 40% of the needed budget."
"A pen manufacturing company needs to deliver 90,000 customized units to a valued customer in 8 weeks. The vendor that will perform the customization is new, but they have agreed to a 2-week time line for their work. The project manager tailors the schedule of this project as follows: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 In which two ways could the project manager tailor this project to reduce risk and ensure prompt delivery of the units? (Choose two) A: Add a schedule contingency of 1 week and notify the customer. B: Prepare to crash the schedule in case phase 2 runs past the projected duration. C: Monitor closely and add a checkpoint during phase 2 to check whether the vendor is progressing on time.
  D: Add a penalty for late delivery to the new vendor’s contract. E: Agree on acceptance criteria for work in each of the four phases.","C, E - FEEDBACK: This question asks which actions would reduce risk and ensure prompt delivery. This project manager is working with a new vendor, which introduces risks related to performance, quality, and time. Working closely with the vendor and adding a governance checkpoint during the vendor’s work interval can reduce risk and ensure prompt delivery. Using a definition of done (DoD) to ensure the quality of the work at each phase applies mutually agreed quality milestones to the schedule. Adding time to the schedule is not an ideal way to treat a longtime customer, as this changes the terms of the delivery. Crashing the schedule introduces much risk, so this is not a good option. Finally, adding a penalty to the new vendor’s contract will not accomplish the objective of reducing risk; in fact, it may add risk by rushing the vendor to complete the work."
"Owners of a small luxury travel magazine want to expand their services to provide bookings for readers’ dream holidays. They commit 15% of the company’s annual profit over 3 years to develop and launch the service. The company creates a high-level vision statement and objectives and key results (OKRs), which they hand over to a consulting company.
 

 Which approach and initial scope decision is suitable for this project to begin work? A: The company should use the OKRs to define the scope statement and the consultants can create a product roadmap
  B: The company should decide on a fixed project scope and time line for delivery and then inform the consultants
  C: The consultants should create a project management plan with a defined scope and scope baseline using the information provided by the company
  D: The consultants should create an initial flexible scope and use progressive elaboration based on an agreed time line E: ","D - FEEDBACK: Essentially, this question asks you to understand how well the scope of this project seems to be defined at this point and which approach may benefit this type of project the most. In this scenario, the company has a high-level vision for the result and no project management expertise. So, while defining an initial scope is possible, a scope statement is not because they lack the expertise. Furthermore, a flexible rather than fixed scope is suitable because the project goals are still undefined—they are still forming ideas. 
 

 The answer needs to acknowledge the role of the hired consultants as the project management experts. While OKRs are useful tools for businesses and project professionals for seeing the bigger picture—the goals of the project and measurable key results for objectives—beginning work based on these and a product roadmap created by consultants is risky."
"A project management office (PMO) is meeting about the next set of internal projects in the company. A facilitator writes the list on the whiteboard and the group makes some notes. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Which project is most suitable for predictive development? A: 1 - Improve order processing and delivery times. B: 2 - Enhance the customer service program. C: 3 - Improve safety and workflow in the factory. D: 4 - Redesign the employee benefits program. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: While all four projects listed on the whiteboard are about improvements or enhancements and all could use a predictive development approach, the question asks which is “most suitable.” For that, we should think about the level of certainty or what’s known about the work as well as the urgency. Projects with a clearly defined scope—including what the work is and how it will be done, the time line, the budget—or a combination of these—are more suited for a predictive development approach than projects in which this information is not known or is uncertain. The nature of a project’s work or a schedule constraint indicates urgency. In this case, project 3 to improve safety and workflow in the factory has a clearly defined scope and is an urgent matter. The team will use items identified in an inspection and make improvements based on them. For the other projects, more information is needed to understand the scope well enough to create a defined scope statement. While all of these improvements will create positive outcomes, considered together, the safety issue may pose the greatest risk to the company."
"A government agency is concerned about the continuity of their projects. Many senior staff members who started the agency are retiring in the next 5 to 10 years. Their knowledge and experience as project managers of past and current projects will be critical to the agency’s future success. 
 

 A project manager is engaged to steer the effort. Which two options are the best ways of ensuring knowledge transfer for continuity of the agency’s projects? (Choose two) A: Create objectives for a mentorship program of junior staff by senior staff and build a knowledge base. 
  B: Capture and archive senior staff member knowledge and establish a community of practice for project management. C: Prioritize building an organizational culture that values mentoring and a growth mindset.
  D: Review the agency’s continuous improvement plan and ensure it is adequate and understood by everyone.
  E: Digitize the lessons learned repository from past projects.","A, B - FEEDBACK: A dwindling knowledge base and the need to transfer knowledge is a growing concern in a wide range of organizations and professional areas, including project management. Storing knowledge or making it accessible is only the first step—it is not the only step. Organizations need to prioritize transferring and using that knowledge as a regular part of professional growth and the organizational culture. A dedicated knowledge base along with a mentorship program or a community of practice, is a good idea for ensuring knowledge is stored and can be easily accessed and transferred on a regular basis."
"A company designs robotic vacuum cleaners. Sales are declining, so the company wants to pursue a business opportunity in a growing market: to adapt their machinery with artificial intelligence (AI) for use as home companions. A senior business analyst completes a feasibility study and examines the opportunity, delivering three main points: 
 

 • Partner with another company to provide AI technology instead of in-house capability development
 • Success could triple the company’s growth over the next 5 years!
 • Expand existing sales channels.
 

 The stakeholders authorize the project unanimously and appoint a project manager to start work. Which two actions should the project manager perform first? (Choose two) A: Determine the contingencies for project risks. B: Request data about the growing market from the senior business analyst. 
  C: Identify the project stakeholders. D: Draft a high-level scope.
  E: Determine resource needs, including personnel and infrastructure changes.","C, D - FEEDBACK: When a project manager receives incomplete or diverse information about a potential project, they need to be able to piece together the desired outcome and components of value for the organization. In this case, a range of information is given—project strategy, growth projection, and identification of capabilities. The project manager should start with what is given, finding out who can help clarify what the project could or should be. Identifying and engaging stakeholders is the critical step to finding out what the project should be. Then they need to create a high-level scope to be able to begin work. The other tasks can wait until after the vision is better understood in collaboration with the stakeholders. If more data about the home companion market is needed, then the project manager should obtain it as part of data gathering. But since the project was already authorized, this information should already be available. At this stage, a project charter could be written. Once this is done, then the resource needs can be determined. Similarly, after the risks are identified, then the contingencies can be determined."
"An agile project team previously attempted to launch a new version of streaming fitness videos in an increasingly competitive market. By the end of the last project, competitors had already launched similar products. Stakeholders were disappointed about the loss of value.
 

 Which two actions should the team leadership have taken or done differently to avoid stakeholder dissatisfaction? (Choose two) A: Increased the pace of work by adding more human resources
  B: Eliminated errors in the work flow and found efficiencies
  C: Conducted more market research before beginning the project
  D: Used shorter cadences to enable better analysis and response to market changes E: Collaborated more closely with stakeholders","D, E - FEEDBACK: The previous attempt was challenging because of the increasingly competitive market and the type of value (first to market) desired by stakeholders. Communication with stakeholders is the most immediate and direct way to understand and pursue what will bring value to the business. The definition of value can shift or change during a project—we can learn about this from effective collaboration with stakeholders. The competition is a part of the external business environment that needs continuous monitoring, especially in highly competitive markets. Use of shorter cadences of work provides greater adaptability for change."
"A project team working in a city’s transportation agency is planning the launch of a 24-hour subway service for the first time in its 120-year history. One month before the launch, a terrible electrical accident shuts down service for the whole city, causing injuries and millions of dollars of damage to the infrastructure. 
 

 What should the project manager do? A: Close the project. B: Consult the communications management plan. C: Review the risk register. D: Contact the project sponsor. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Disaster has struck this project. A risk has become an issue and the project manager needs to review the register to know what the response should be. Closing the project may happen later, after assessment and consultation with the sponsor, the organization, and stakeholders. The appropriate communications can be known by consulting the communications management plan."
"A project to train kitchen personnel in process efficiencies for a restaurant franchise has a small project team of four people. It is essential that this team has a broad understanding of the franchise's business processes so they can create training that delivers the efficiencies required across the business.
 

 Which team member already has T-shaped skills that would be beneficial to this project?
 

 A - Project manager with 30 years of experience leading business development projects
 B - Training specialist with 10 years of experience in menu development  
 C - Team member with 5 years of experience leading teams, who also is scrum master 
 D - Team lead for finance and operations, who was once the owner/operator of a franchise
  A: Team member A
  B: Team member B
  C: Team member C
  D: Team member D E: ","D - FEEDBACK: The T-shaped team member is the team lead for finance and operations. Because of their experience running this kind of business, this team member has the greatest depth and breadth of relevant experience among the four listed."
"At the beginning of a customer service improvement project, two stakeholders are noted as “resistant” on the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix (SEAM): 

• A finance executive who says the cost of the project is too high
• The customer care team that wants better salaries and working conditions.
 
All other stakeholders support the project. 
 
After months of difficult negotiations, the customer care stakeholder group is now noted as “neutral,” though final agreements must be signed; this is ongoing and will take significant time and effort. The finance executive continues to state that the cost of the project is too high.
 
What should the project manager do?
  
A: Use personal influence to gain agreement with the finance executive while negotiations with the customer care stakeholders continue.
B: Focus on negotiating the final agreements for the customer care stakeholder group at a cost that also satisfies the finance executive.
C: Ask the supportive stakeholders to explain or justify the cost of the salary increases to the finance executive.
D: Send an email to all stakeholders, stating the problem and urging them to find a solution. ","B - FEEDBACK: The only way to successfully steward this project to conclusion is to gain the consent of both resistant stakeholders. Right now, they are siloed from one another, but their issues with the project are interdependent. Going for a “quick win” by using personal influence is risky because stakeholders need real solutions that deliver benefits. Asking one set of stakeholders to mediate a solution with another is not appropriate for a project steward. That is the project professional’s job. Asking all the stakeholders to find a solution seems more like abdicating responsibility than managing a project. The only way forward is to negotiate with the customer care stakeholders toward a mutually agreed set of conditions that will also satisfy the finance executive’s concerns about cost."
"An agile team member has an extremely varied skill set and performs their work well on projects. This team member has been allocated to many different roles during their work history at the company. For this reason, the team member states, ""I feel like I am put on projects randomly. I am not getting anywhere, and the company does not value my work."" 
 
What should the team lead do?
 
A: Coach the team member and help them to find a suitable mentor for career development.
B: Reassure the team member about their value as a T-shaped team member.
C: Encourage the team member to become more emotionally intelligent
D: Urge the team member to get as many certifications as possible. ","A - FEEDBACK: The team member’s perception of their professional value is flawed. This is a T-shaped team member, or a generalizing specialist, which is the ideal kind of project team member. They need to be coached so that they understand this and should be encouraged to find a mentor who can help them add professional value to their career. All other options are valid ways of increasing our professional value, but in this case, the problem is that the team member misunderstands how valuable they already are."
"An established farm is struggling to maintain profitability and plans to integrate an agro-tourism project to expand the business. They hire a project manager and personnel and initiate a project. The new team members will be shared resources for both the farm and the playground project. The farm needs to continue generating cash flow to support operations until the project is integrated--in 8 months.
 
By the second month, the project manager learns that farm production performance has decreased drastically because the project takes up a lot of the team's time. Which two approaches should the project manager consider to provide the best chance for the business to succeed and produce the desired outcomes? (Choose two) 

A: Establish clear role delineations for the team members. 
B: Create roadmaps for farm production and the playground project, with clear value delivery goals for each. 
C: Focus on the farm operations first to stabilize processes because this is the main revenue earner. 
D: Create a project management plan that combines the farm and the playground. E: Decide between the farm or the playground business option.","A, B - FEEDBACK: This project manager needs to use the right tools and techniques to assist in ensuring successful outcomes. In this case, a set of roadmaps and clearer role delineation should result in better team performance. By creating roadmaps for farm production and the playground project, the project manager will underline the value delivery goals and be able to focus on delivering them. Since the farm and playground are sharing resources, the best choice is to figure out how to execute work now that leads to desired outcomes. A project management plan for the playground should already exist, but the farm business is the business operation, which is outside the scope of the project. Splitting the businesses or giving up one are both possible, but the question asks which option provides the best chance for the businesses to succeed and produce desired outcomes."
"A company is undergoing a global enterprise-level transformation. In 3 years, they will end 85 years of publishing books and instead offer tutored, virtual learning communities. 
 
The first big project is to refit the factories and warehouses as film studios. The project management office (PMO) authorizes a project using a predictive life cycle, and that work begins. However, the learning community designers (key stakeholders) keep requesting design changes, which has caused delays and costly rework. With 18 months left, the team is getting nervous.
 
How should the project manager respond? 

A: Continue to process the designers’ changes using the change control process. 
B: Suspend the project until the designers finalize their decisions and then restart work.
C: Limit the changes to critical ones only and initiate another project afterwards to retrofit the studios with further changes.
D: Pivot to an iterative development approach to capture designer feedback at set intervals during construction. E: ","D - FEEDBACK: When a project is being delayed consistently and significantly with changes from stakeholders, it is time to consider a different approach to handling changes. In this case, the team can take the designers’ feedback in iterations as part of the project work. This will ensure the project continues to develop what the company really needs. In this case, the other approaches suggested would eventually work, but the work needs to be done and ready in a demanding time line."
"During a busy period of organizational change, team members on project L are allocated as follows: 

 • 60% of working hours – project L
 • 20% of working hours – company-wide organizational change project
 • 20% of working hours – functional role
 
Project L is progressing according to schedule and budget, but a few minor quality factors are being neglected. The project manager is prioritizing on-time delivery and the very dedicated team asks about working overtime to improve quality. 

 How should the project manager respond? 

A: Avoid granting the overtime request; instead, ask the functional managers if the project can borrow them for a few weeks.
B: Avoid granting the overtime request; instead, ask the organizational change project leader to do without them for a few weeks. 
C: Collaborate with the managers and the organizational change project leader to compromise on how team members can spend more time on project L.
D: Grant the overtime request for the team members and find a way to pay for it with the existing project budget. E: ","C - FEEDBACK: Organizational changes or transformations are a very busy time for organizations. In these cases, it is imperative to collaborate with stakeholders in a positive way. Especially when sharing resources, project leaders need to realize that they may already be stretched between the roles they are assigned on projects, their functional or organizational roles, and their participation in the transformation work. In this case, the quality issues are minor. If they were major issues, the project manager should definitely assess them and decide on action. However, an additional challenge here would be the budget and whether the project would be able to pay for the overtime."
"A hotel chain wants to improve the customer loyalty program by increasing the number of returning guests by 35%. The project manager finds two strong opinions: 
 
 • Stakeholder J suggests that the sales teams focus on the top 10 corporate clients and incentivize them toward exclusive use of this hotel chain
 
 • Stakeholder M suggests improving the quality of their airport sites, which already have a large number of repeat guests. Stakeholder M also insists the chain cannot compete in larger markets, so the strategy stakeholder J suggests will fail. 
 
 In a dramatic escalation, stakeholder M sends an email to the project manager and the entire leadership team accusing stakeholder J of having a bias. 

 What should the project manager do first? 

A: Mediate between the two stakeholders and determine an initial scope that satisfies both.
B: Coach stakeholder M about professional behavior and ask them to apologize to stakeholder J.
C: Escalate this as an issue to human resources.
D: Remove stakeholder M from the project for violation of ethical standards. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: The problem in this scenario is stakeholder M’s behavior, which is challenging. Accusing stakeholder J of having a bias could be perceived as a personal attack, but it could also be a very awkward way of stating a fact. We know that conflict is in a mature stage (“contest” in the Leas model) and must be handled right away. Trying one more time to determine an initial scope is the best answer. It focuses on the solution and not the personal battle. However, if neither coaching nor mediation work, escalation may become the only option. It is likely not within any project manager’s authority to remove stakeholders from projects, even though this would bring a calmer situation."
"At the start of a project, stakeholders agreed to expedite approval of the project charter and project management plan to get the project started on time. But after the first sample batch is sent to the customer, a serious problem is discovered: 

Customer: “Samples sent over for approval are inferior, with failure rate of 27%. . . thought we agreed 15% as maximum failure rate.”
 
The project manager checks the project management plan and discovers that “good quality” was noted as the acceptance criteria instead of the usual number range for failure rate. The other stakeholders are willing to approve the batch with a 20-25% failure rate, but the customer rejects this idea.
 
What should the project manager do, and which artifact should be updated? 

A: Update the project management plan with the required 15% failure rate and seek approval to deliver the goods incrementally, with some past the original due date. 
B: Persuade the customer to accept the loss in quality in exchange for on-time delivery and update the issue log and lessons learned. 
C: Collaborate with all the stakeholders to agree on the quality standard and acceptance criteria, then update the quality policy for the project before continuing the work. 
D: Resolve the quality problem, per the customer's acceptance criteria and update the issue log and project management plan. ","D - FEEDBACK: Rushing to start this project with unclear documentation was clearly the cause of a misunderstanding. Misunderstandings must be resolved to fulfill project goals and successful project outcomes. This is especially true of a customer's requirement! When a project has already started based on a misunderstanding, you need to think and act decisively while stewarding the project toward successful outcomes. Of these four choices, resolving the quality problem and updating the project management plan achieves these two goals in the best way. The product will meet the customer's quality standard and the project management plan will reflect the work. Prioritizing on-time delivery to please the customer might seem to be a good idea at first, but if the goods do not meet the acceptance criteria, the company risks losing a customer and a good reputation."
"A project that is in progress requires a resource with a specialized skill. Because of time limitations, the agile team has two options: either borrow a team member from another department who can work part-time or use an independent contractor. The eight team members discuss the options, but they are unable to reach an agreement. The vote is 50/50, and both options have positive benefits as well as risks. 

What should the team do? 

A: Use Roman voting. 
B: Empower the team lead to make a decision based on multicriteria analysis.
C: Wait until the next retrospective and ask again.
D: Ask the product owner to decide.","B - FEEDBACK: In this case, the team faces a true deadlock in voting on an issue where support for the choices is equally balanced. Roman voting would continue to produce the same results. A time limitation means that waiting for the next retrospective is not the best option. The product owner is not the expert on project work, so the best choice here is to empower the team lead to make a decision based on data. This choice maintains the elements of a data-driven decision made by a member of the team in a timely manner."
"A project will create digital keys for 18,500 employees at an airport. The project management plan states that security clearance data for employees must be verified and updated in a digital security file every 6 months. This is part of the acceptance criteria. In month 3, the project manager discovers that the company hired to maintain the digital security files has filed for bankruptcy.
 
Which statement describes the status of this project? 

A: This project will fail.
B: This project has an issue.
C: This project is noncompliant.
D: This project is high risk. ","B - FEEDBACK: This project has an issue arising from a risk, and it is quite serious. The project manager must now manage this issue to move the project forward. If it is possible to find another vendor or way to manage the digital security file requirement, the project might succeed, and it may even fulfill the outcomes on time. Security is a compliance issue; however, if the issue is resolved in a positive manner, the threat of noncompliance may be averted."
"A pharmaceutical company has manufactured its best-selling product for more than 50 years. Production has steadily increased, and the company is ready to make a significant investment to expand the business. 
 
Leadership asks the project management team to carefully assess the risk of this expansion. What should the team focus on? 

A: Stakeholder profiles
B: Last year’s annual budget
C: Product roadmap 
D: Company’s mission statement ","C - FEEDBACK: The team needs to understand the full scope of the expansion to determine risk. The product roadmap, an artifact created by the business, should contain the vision and direction for the product, and the team can assess risk based on this vision and direction. All the other information could be helpful as context, but a risk assessment of the expansion begins with the product roadmap."
"A financial services project will be executed by a team of three teams. Each team has unique objectives for the first phase and then will merge efforts for the second phase to deliver the product. The product owner wants it done as soon as possible. In the initial draft of the schedule, team A finishes their work in a 9-week time line, but teams B and C need 14 weeks to complete their work. 
 
The scrum master suggests allocating resources from team A to teams B and C during weeks 10-12, to shorten the total time line. Teams B and C agree and would like the added resources. However, team A says “no” because they need to prepare the transition plan and train staff on the product during weeks 10-14.

Which two actions should happen? (Choose two) 

A: The product owner should reprioritize the backlog.
B: The teams should decide their own schedules.
C: The teams should hold a scrum of scrums to decide the schedule.
D: The scrum master should facilitate a planning retrospective.
E: The product owner should add the transition requirements to the backlog.","C, E - FEEDBACK: These teams are not communicating with each other about the time they need to produce the work, nor with the product owner about the training and transition plans that are required to deliver the product. The product owner can communicate their requirements to the team through the backlog. That is where the work is described to the team, which can then decide on how to execute it, because they know best what is needed to complete this project successfully and deliver the product ASAP. Clearly, the training and transition requirements have not been discussed. In a scrum of scrums meeting, the teams can discuss how the required work should be completed and agree on a schedule."
"A project manager in a luggage manufacturing company is asked to explore new business opportunities and deliver three proofs of concepts (POCs) to the executive team. Sales are declining rapidly and the company’s future is at risk. The 15 project team members are stakeholders from all over the organization, chosen for their independent thinking. They have very different points of view about which opportunities are best, and arguments are erupting openly and often.
 
Because of the varied points of view, the project manager adopts an agile approach to quickly build shared understanding about the work and find the best solutions to present to the executive team. Which two approaches should the project manager consider? (Choose two) 

A: Train stakeholders on how to create user stories and story map of their ideas to share these with the whole group and vote for the three best to create the POCs.
B: Supervise the work but empower three agile teams of five people each to self-organize and ideate new business concepts as user stories to be reviewed at retrospectives and then developed iteratively.
C: Send a survey to the 15 stakeholders asking for new business ideas and concepts; share all the answers anonymously and then vote on the three best.
D: Prioritize the executive or senior stakeholders’ ideas; empower them as team leads of self-organizing agile teams that deliver POCs to the company incrementally.
E: Ask each stakeholder to create a vision statement and use an Extreme Programming (XP) metaphor to explain their best idea; all stakeholders vote for the three best and develop them as POCs.","A, B - FEEDBACK: Because a proof of concepts (POCs) demonstrates feasibility, that efficacy, in addition to time and democratic ideation, are important in this scenario. The two best options to meet all of these requirements are A and B. The story mapping technique is suitable for discovery work and for larger groups to organize and visualize the user stories and develop their work. Allowing each person to ideate and then vote on the three best is an effective way of listening to diverse points of view and making decisions. The other option that can work is empowering self-organizing agile teams—breaking the larger group into smaller ones that can handle conflict productively and work better. The last three options are less promising approaches. A survey is a useful tool for capturing diverse opinions, but this answer does not allow for conflict to produce ideas nor prove the ideas can work. Empowering the senior stakeholders is controversial because it prioritizes people based on their jobs. The stakeholders on this project have an equal voice, so it is unwise—and not agile—to create a hierarchy. The final option of using a vision statement and XP metaphor is a promising beginning, but the story mapping and adaptive development methods are better because they will include greater detail about the business ideas and be closer to a POC, which is the desired outcome."
"A virtual team will travel to a work site and work as a colocated team for 6 weeks in Q3 of next year to transition their project to the customer. One team member, whose role is critical to the transition, is getting married during Q3 but has not told anyone until now. This team member requested 3 weeks of holiday right before the planned team travel. 
 
What should the project manager do? 

A: Ask another team member to job shadow this team member as a contingency.
B: Reject the request because this team member's role is critical.
C: Plan for the risk of a delayed transition because of this team member’s absence.
D: Replace the team member now to avoid disruption next year. E: ","A - FEEDBACK: This scenario shows a normal part of working life, and the best response is to mitigate this team member's absence as a single point of failure by asking someone else on the team to expand their skillset. With time to plan for resource coverage, there should be no delay or disruption! While rejecting the request is a possible answer, it is an overreach of authority and an overreaction. And the project manager should definitely send a note of congratulations to the team member!"
